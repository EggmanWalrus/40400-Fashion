    "Today, we're going to attempt to discover if there are any conventional interpretants for Zegna's Uomo cologne. In class on Tuesday, we saw that the product was intended to produce interpretants related to the concepts of masculinity, mastery and sophistication. Today, we are evaluating whether these are the sorts of interpretants that are actually produced in the circles of interpreters outside of individual advertisement that we watched by analyzing the words used in YouTube videos and the things that appear in images related to the Zegna brand more generally on Flickr."

    "One way we might begin to understand some of the interpretants produced from the Uomo sign vehicle is to identify the objects that are in images and videos related to the Zegna brand as a whole. You might remember that the advertisement we watched on Tuesday begins with the phrase \"Ermenegildo Zegna Presents...\" and this Zegna name seems to be a key part in the labeling of this product. What meaning does this brand name bestow upon the product? We might begin to understand the interpretant(s) of \"Ermenegildo Zegna\" by identifying the entities that commonly occur in photos related to the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Flickr API and a pre-trained computer vision algorithm with Google Cloud Vision's API that detects objects in images related to the term \"Ermenegildo Zegna\" to try to identify general patterns in the way in which photographers on Flickr compose their photos related to the Zegna brand (professional shots of models, as well as from the general public). Note that in this scenario, we are not only using an API to get pre-existing data (Flickr), but also to process data for us (Google Cloud Vision).\n",

    "It takes a bit too long to run this code as an in-class exercise (and requires getting an API key for the Flickr API, or some other image sharing website, along with a Google Cloud API key), but I'd encourage you to play around with and expand upon this approach on your own and/or work with image/video data in this way in your final projects.\n",

    "If we wanted to detect custom entities that are outside the scope of Google's pre-trained algorithms, we could also train our own machine learning algorithms. For instance, in my own work, I've trained classifiers to identify archaeological sites from vast amounts of satellite image data (using Python's OpenCV and Scikit learn packages). This involves feeding a classification algorithm a lot of images with labels of what is in them, so that it can begin to learn for itself how they are used. This is about as deep as we will get into these approaches in this class, but I'd encourage you to explore these approaches in your final projects if you'd like to work with images."

However, I find it significantly easier in Python to use the third-party scraper [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme). The advantage of using `youtube_dl` is that it provides a framework for downloading video data on other streaming sites as well (for instance, Vimeo and TikTok) and returns JSON formatted data in the same way as the official YouTube API. One disadvantage, however, is that it does not return comment data from YouTube. You will need to use the official YouTube API if you want to collect comments for videos."
