Smell: A clean peppery citrus with a metallic feel to it. It's very clean and it has a lot of character added to it. Type of fragrance: Casual. Longevity: Not too bad, about   hours.

Could there be a more ravishing work of architecture than Casa Malaparte? \u201cA beautiful thing, forged out of a brutal environment,\u201d is how architect Simon Jacobsen describes this minimalist plinth of a house, built in   atop a craggy promontory on the island of Capri. \u201cIt makes you think of Greta Garbo\u2019s famous line, \u2018I want to be alone.\u2019 \u201d Its owner did, by all accounts. Curzio Malaparte was a brash man of letters who fell afoul of Mussolini in   and was exiled to a speck of land in the Mediterranean. Banishment had a paradoxical effect: Upon his release, Malaparte longed for more remoteness and seclusion. After buying a site on Capri\u2019s eastern coastline, he had the noted architect Adalberto Libera draw up plans for a home, but later threw them out in favor of his own vision\u2014a stolid, jutting form, with a lyrical windbreak on top and a tapering exterior staircase. \u201cA house like me,\u201d Malaparte often said. Today the dwelling is owned by the writer\u2019s heirs and most easily seen by boat (or by revisiting Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s   film Contempt, in which the roof provides a sunbathing venue for Brigitte Bardot). Interior designer Steven Volpe got a rare private invitation years ago and remembers walking the tortuous footpath, touring the hauntingly spartan rooms\u2014and, most vividly, climbing to the rooftop. \u201cUp there it was dream-like,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in heaven.\u201d  architecturaldigest.com","28":"Facebook   IG    Henry's review  ","29":"Justin reviews Ermenegildo Zegna\u2019s Zegna Uomo, a citrus fragrance perfect for the summertime.

reason it's just  tipping I've been skipping and skipping  it and it this is a fragrance I really  want to talk about because I think this  is one of my most favorite fragrances in  the recent times and fragrance also is  the very first from this house that I  own and the house is called Xenia okay I  hope I'm pronouncing that correct and it  will be seeing the review today oh  zinnias boom oh so boom oh and now in  Italian it means men okay so zinnias  meant very bold statement it's built for  men this is their flagship and I will  talk about everything in got from this  so far why I love it let me tell you  right away I love this fragrance this is  one fragrance I think it's highly  underrated its criminally underrated how  good this is I'll tell you everything  you need to know about this and I'll  tell you two story two stories before I  start first of all this fragrance I saw  it when I was still in Malaysia like we  used to travel a lot you know like  different airports different like not  different of course we have like two  airports in KL kuala lumpur one is the  main airport KLIA and this KL I had to  column for International Airport so  often eyes to go there sometimes if I  cannot find a fragrance who knows they  have their fragrance shops like  boutiques out there and they're open  until midnight or so I don't know about  now back the idea I used to be that case  I used to go and then see like different  fragrance and sometimes they had like  you know promotion going on and there's  a fragrance shop also in this myths we  outlet park there's a huge shopping mall  near at the airport so I saw this  fragrance a couple of times but the  price was so high  okay this price was for this fragrance  there Malaysia it's all reachable  Malaysia Indonesia Singapore Thailand  Bruning this countries if you go you're  gonna have to pay very high price  because their taxes are quite  so I thought this phrase was very  interested I saw Chad's review I saw one  any other like few other videos but I  really liked Dan my knickers mesh I  liked his video on this and I'll tell  you why and he described his frigging so  well it got me so interested I saw it I  snapped it I really liked the bottle  this bottle is so lovely  I wanted it in my collection but for  some reason I never got it and the  reason was obviously the price was too  high and recent times one of my sisters  like she lives in North rec real sister  but we I call her sister so she lives in  UK and she came from UK recently with a  few gifts for different people right and  she gave me gifts as well but then she  said I'm so sorry  I have this one thing I bought for you a  fragrance but my husband soil and he  sniffed it and he fell in love with it  instantly and he kept it and I couldn't  say anything and it was the interesting  story and then she brought me the this  one this is body wash this is 3.4 mm  like hundred mo sorry 2.4 fluid ounces  and she's like would you like to keep it  like I'm like okay hell yes I would like  to try it again I forward the smell of  it so opened it right I opened it and I  sniffed it like if you open it you  snippet it smells amazing it smelled  amazing and I saw that I heard the story  that has been kept it that's when I  realized I need this fragrance I kept  looking for it a good deal then I  finally found it you know I asked my  brother upfront buy from us be paid in  Bangladesh so you got it for me  so finally have it so that's basically  two stories on to tell you so right now  I'm so happy this fragrance it's unique  it's a really unique fragrance it's a  hidden gem as I was telling you it's  criminally underrated and became very  close to my heart let me show you  presentation there's the very standard  box nothing special about it I like this  it's very old  like all days like 90s very 90s of style  okay very simple boom Oh statement it's  a little bit like a I don't know what  color is this it sort of like a the  fragrance itself smells like this this  color is like sort of greyish  okay off-white like that and the house  name is Enya and these are designed in  Milano okay and fragrance is made in  Switzerland  I don't have that many fragrances like  in the tom forese my black work is made  in Switzerland so yet some informations  100 mil EDT also comes in 3050 and also  comes in  aftershave as well so yes there's a  complete product line as well as there's  an intense version of this fragrance and  a lot more other I haven't tried so many  zinnias this is my first any as I told  you so the reason first isn't for me to  one the fragrance is the bottle this is  very simple looking bottle right it  looks like very as simple as it can get  simplistic but taste sophistication in  this there's like you know can hear the  sound yes it's like sort of like lines  it says warm oh it looks like we know  basically with you know back in the days  it's like what you call those things I  don't know these to put in the car like  a window I don't know just to block the  Sun and stuff pretty cool looking water  well it looks like Robocop I don't know  very silverish and see to bottle look at  that bottle it looks very very beautiful  very thin so it's tall 100 mil but you  might confuse it with 200 mil or  something like that and you can see the  juice from every angle okay and says one  more in front and bottom is your sticker  and stuff yeah and up there you're gonna  get the name of the house okay like this  the cap is very robust it goes with the  body just like Versace's menu fresh yeah  it goes like that okay and it's very  nice solid very solid plastic cap  sprayer on this is very very good  okay maybe not very very good it's like  it's okay it's the oke distribution is  less six of them so that's with the  presentation and now let's talk about  this fragrance this fragrance is known  in the community to be very close to  wire salom\u00e9 Libra okay so lonely right  now is discontinued and many people are  not very biggest fan of that fragrance  right the main reason for that is that  that violet node up top is not  everybody's cup of tea and it's kind of  a sharp and metallic this fragrance  however I think is better than that  fragrance and this frame is very unique  this is summer spring this is  long-lasting okay I'll tell you how it  smells in a bit and few other things  okay really unique why am i say unique  in a you know the crowd of Sabah's or  Invictus occurs today you know if you  find a lot of similar fragrances  everything does like things like kind of  similar similar you know you smell it  and you're like oh okay I've seen smell  it before these fragrance you smell it  you you just feel like wow what a  fragrance now let me scratch on man okay  so the opening burst is you know very  sharp it has a beautiful citrus s but  it's done in a style that Italians do  it's very Italian like like Ferrari if  you feel for a familiar with their way  of fragrances it has a sort of feel of  Gucci poram to Fahrenheit that has that  that the violence right away you can  smell the citrus and the violet right up  top and it's just lovely it opens up  also very fresh like the seaside if you  think of equity Co it also has that feel  and it goes to a dry down it also has a  feel of equity to you as well it borrows  a lot of elements from different  fragrances but the opening will also  remind you of where such is menu fresh  this to a pretty much seaside by the  beach on the sand but this is more like  a daytime this is a fragrance I think of  Dan my makers Mitch said you're sitting  by the beach on the beach after the rain  has gone past thunderstorm I can smell  the wet here you know like and he's just  sniffing it and he's just getting the  fresh breeze of the ocean as well as the  smell of the rain still in the air I'm  adding up some of my points and it  smells like there's a little bit  somewhere because like thunderstorm  there was like a ashy or like a chrome  sort of a feel somewhere like a metallic  somewhat feels somewhere so it's very  unique it gives you that a wet air feel  coming from the sea and there's a dark  clouds just a little bit distance from  you and you're watching that right and  you can see like thunderstorm from far  away right so the sand is wet trying to  think of it the sand is wet and you're  sitting on it and just getting the  essence of the sea this is what this  fragrance is all about and then slowly  the citrus will go away and then that  that violet to start taking over  gives you the feel I don't like it  because of the shower kill or not it  gives you fresh out of the shower as  well for a very long time the strong  points of this fragrance it lasts a very  long time it some people if you apply  too much I would say three sprays good  enough for the whole working day but if  you goes liberal like seven is crazy  you'll get headache if the Sun comes up  much later so it's good for spring even  in the winter you can wear it but some  are also shines it's a twelve-months  fragrance good performer throughout the  year just like your siwash okay this  fragrant got lost in time people don't  talk about it nowadays everything is  about the Rays latest fragrance latest  references this is one good goodie you  know this is one goodie also look at the  bottle of oil it will remind you of  Prada amber okay on the side okay there  you know comparison so very basically  very everything every angle of this  fragrance it's a very favorite of mine I  often wake up first thing I put up to  the shower is this frame if I go for  morning walk this fragrance you can wait  for work it will also give you a little  bit of darkness much later there is  definite darkness it has a fresh out of  the shower like you know not cheap  cleaning products okay like a soapy  clean but nothing musky or powder eNOS  that's what I love about this ring so it  has elements of as you as I told you  wear such is menu fresh but not exactly  but the citrus is it pours from this so  it opens up with a citrus that violet  from Gucci Purim - if you like that if  you like Fahrenheit d-squared he would  and then slowly it will go to the  oceanic feel of equity to you that air -  the salt that's what I get from insane  ears whoa this is and criminally  underrated fragrance as I told you I  think I love this over many other my  other of my latest purchases and it's a  very signature scent worthy you can go  through bottles after bottles you can  just absolutely be addicted to this  fragrance it can be a signature scent  alright so I suggest you look into this  fragrance  Xenia zoomy it's gonna get you  complement you can wear this you can be  mysterious at the same time it gonna be  fresh not superb the projection on this  is not this more it's not like he's  gonna come and catch people but it's  gonna give your fragrance it's not true  - other people's noses  they're gonna love how sophisticated you  are it's gonna be in the workplace  you're gonna be very unique because  nothing smells like this today  all right very unique unique inspector  is awesome on this okay  so I'm a little bit hyping it up because  I believe this kind of readiness does  need more love okay if you haven't tried  it I suggest you go and try it I think  and find it at discounted price many in  many places it can be a cheap es  sometimes alright but don't pay retail  like 7kt dollars that I saw in Malaysia  I didn't buy it and I'm very happy this  was I wanted to just to see this pop in  my collection as well that was my  personal reason and I loved the juice  it's amazing juice all right it can may  use daytime nighttime any part of the  year as I told you  complements it will be there but this is  more like a man imagining gray suit  sophisticated softly spoken doesn't  speak so much confident he knows his  stuff very confident guy it smells like  a very confident guy all right so I  think Bangladesh are conditioned  this would be great it'll be great a  fresh semi fresh sort of a fragrance for  all your own okay and you can always  feel good about owning this fragrance  okay so longevity on this are very good  prediction also not bad at all smell  also I would say highly I'll read this  idea and I'll give this like 9 out of 10  that much I love this fragrance guys so  it's a great special fragrance to me  after all that history and whatever us  telling you and it's definitely worth  looking at okay  very unique fragrance in the crowd of  all the other fragrance that smell alike  right that's my review for zinnias ooh  whoa boom oh definitely look into this  and if you can try the intense version  let me know how that smells maybe I'll  get that too alright that's all I have  for today have a very good a day or  evening wherever you are signing off  from talk about mothership Bowie  ","1":"   what's going on guys so today's video I  got the professor but what are your  what's your really Steven and I have a  YouTube channel called R adolescence  alright so today we're actually going to  be doing a smell and rate on what helps  on the house of etem in Aikido zhenia  now so this is actually gonna be the  exact same type of video that I did with  Steven a year and a half ago on me  Shelley gentlemen I remember that video  it wasn't exactly a very serious video  all right  now you're not very familiar with this  brand are you no not necessarily a  perhaps own one or two of their  fragrances which ones but hmm off the  top of my head I don't remember  Oh aqua tea better gemalto which is not  even gonna be in the sample and I  personally love the job it was featured  in one of my top summer lists maybe  that's the only one that I own from this  house these are gonna be from the  designer line not from their upper line  okay yeah it's not gonna be from the  elements of man which we've smoked  before yes so some of these fragrances  are very hard to come by so they're  discontinued they're rare they're rare  you ready to begin I would love to all  right started okay first one is gonna be  Zegna sea energy so a lot of these  you've probably never even heard of her  no I personally haven't only the ones  that are spotlighted at my Macy's oh but  they usually just carry one or two okay  so like you said a lot of these get  phased out after a while yeah so we're  gonna pair it up against Zegna Z so  energy is a flanker of Zegna Z this is  the original got it  so I'm really into this house they were  probably surpassed Ferrari believe it or  not you know if I had to stick with one  house only yeah it would be Zen really  so we got the Z against the energy which  one do you prefer  oh okay I see what they did with the  difference here so Z definitely has a  commercial vibe it's fresh something  along the lines of like a D or savage  but not quite that sharp in citrusy okay  the more citrusy iteration would be Z  energy okay that one I personally love I  get the bergamot I get a little bit of  neroli maybe a little like orange  blossom and I like the energy okay and  all I'm asking is which one I prefer  I'm so sorry I'm gonna make this video  like half an hour the energy so next one  is gonna be a very hard one to pronounce  that yeah it sends that DS Enya aqua did  the state summer fragrance so this one  is very hard to come by I'll let you get  it off eBay okay let me remind myself  what the first one I was like okay  [Music]  that's different now I wanted to do  something different with Stephen and I  know that he was he would never be  familiar with this house no there's  other ones you're introducing yeah but  this house is very underrated this one  almost has like a violet leaf vibe I  still like Z energy oh yeah  if maybe perhaps if they took that  violet thing that I'm picking up on and  made it a little bit stronger really  brought it to the fore I would have  enjoyed a little bit more but Z is  easing it well the energy is the one  that I like next one Zegna Forte so  based off the color of the bottle and  the name this gives me the impression  that it's gonna be a little bit heavier  let's see if it follows through I could  smell it from here  hmm wow man that's good okay does it  remind you of anything though yes what  it kind of like an Armani collude vibe  yes is that accurate really it I find it  has that yeah yeah but with honey honey  is a note so I'll take the old one and  I'll toss it okay I like this one I  really do right then okay your taste  good good stuff you know what it is to a  lot of the people who love like a taro  wanted by naive Paco Rabanne 1 million  pre Bay if you're a fan the fragrances  within that genre or that family this is  one that you ought to check out okay  yeah it's good next one  Zegna Z New York we're Jersey but we in  New York that one really speaks to my  sentiments right let's see why they're  so gonna small the first one  which is Forte okay this video is gonna  be very long Steven okay again  commercial appeal  they added a subtle new wants to take it  in a new direction I think I still like  the Forte Tom okay I like the poor tech  rum Artemisia and patchouli yeah I get  that I have a feeling that a lot of what  I pick up in the rum is not going to  sustain itself in the longevity so but  this one the more that I smell it it  feels like it's holding up next one is  one that you smell the farro that we  reviewed Zegna Zee Shanghai  now you spelt this over five months ago  it was actually at metal one shop so  this is the second freshest scent that  you had me trying today okay with the  first one being energy okay and you know  what I gravitate towards great fresh  sense but if I had to go with one I  think I would still go for that okay now  you just said that you like you  gravitate towards fresh sense right yeah  Zac nizzy fresh all right so that's the  name Zegna Zee fresh I'm glad they  didn't call it zenia's e-sport yes now  this one is really hard to come by as  well so eBay or don't tell me that cuz  if I end up liking it I'm gonna go on  eBay and paperwork you like the second  is you fresh or the for tip now I could  smell it from the tester right now yeah  yeah but you know what I don't like it  as much as the open energy is there a  particular note that you get understand  maybe like an herbal I don't know if  it's like Clary sage or something that  is used in a lot of oceanic fragrances  that gives it freshness juniper berries  okay yeah it definitely has an  astringent vibe but I like it but not as  much as the other one worse so I'll  stick with the Forte for now next one is  egg now warm oh so we had a little  splash on here  Zegna woman for the fourth quarter so  this one has a distinguished vibe about  it definitely masculine there's a  freshness to it very appealing easygoing  I'm gonna go you know what I'll go with  the Forte stone so this one was really  hard to get it's a deacon it's Zegna he  sends a DS egg for men is that one of  the older ones I believe so actually  yeah probably since it's hard to find I  did get this one off DK shop I only  heard about this one when I was on  fragrance by dots yeah okay and they  were always out of it Wow like it again  this is the first time that I'm smelling  this one okay really oh you had a hard  time spraying it there I noticed that so  this smells like what fragrance it  smelled like before they get be  formulated yeah okay definitely it packs  a punch it's pungent but in a good way  right it's not an offensive aroma Forte  definitely feels like it's heading in a  direction that appeals to the sentiments  of the modern crowd this one is a little  bit more gentlemanly and refined  definitely appeals to a more mature  crowd I still want to go with Forte we  have three scents remaining Zegna Z  Milan is that Nezumi lon  or the Forte how's your nose good  alright two more did you save that  purposely no I'm just grabbing whatever  you know that's interesting  that's interesting yeah all right did a  video with Matt different did a video  with max 40 there's something unusual  and peculiar about this one what's on  this one big Santa would Clara sage Wow  yeah I like the fig I'm always reminded  of Marc Jacobs for men but that's  creamier a little butyric this one  actually like the freshness that's  counter parted with the fig this one  this is  Wow I haven't smelled like a fig like  this under designer market room yeah all  the things that are talked about are  like Filosa COEs purple fake by vilhelm  your next one is going to be a travel  spray this one is probably the hardest  one to come by when it comes to the  Zetas the discontinued zing is and only  one reviewer I just talked about this  one Vitor ah from soda yep what we're  gonna be doing is Egizi extreme so Mila  or the extreme  this is the last one now we got one more  one more and the last one is gonna be  Zegna intensive for the wind Milan or  the intensive which one goes home let me  smell the Milan again alright man is he  ever serious look at that face he's  taking it in the focus the intensity I  have no life neither does this man here  what you want you prefer men you know  intense those good you like it it's good  yeah which one I understand well which  one goes on there's no time there's only  one winner  I'm sorry for making this video as long  as it is taking all things into  consideration the versatility the  wearability the likability shut up  giggling take a damn which one goes on  and the winner is  Milan guys in the Elan for the win yeah  now before I talk about this one this  one here so Henry from class he sent  says this one smells a lot like cold  harmonica  would you agree yeah yeah it does now  which one smells more like code the  Forte or this you know the Forte kind of  reminded me of code unaccounted that  sweetness okay a tonka bean but this one  is more in the vein of code when all of  the pieces of the puzzle come together  okay why did Milan win so Milan won  because a it features an ingredient that  I really like and all a fig is synthetic  by the way there's no such thing as a  natural fig they can't distill the  essence from it so they understand word  and I liked how they didn't just put out  something rushed or something plain and  simple and underwhelming okay this is if  you put this in a niche bottle and try  to sell it to somebody you'd get away  with it  yeah I love this and how much do you  think that this would go for is it  discontinued it's a limited edition but  it's you can get it online rather reason  I would say MSRP like retail probably  like 94 the big size but on fragrance  net that's it I'm gonna say 50 or 60 25  to 35 yaha 25 to 30 kidding no get out  of here so guys the ultimate winner is  Zegna Zima alliance with Stephen thank  you very much for doing the video you  Chad I really do appreciate it  yes the guys are all attached Steve is  link down below just in case by some  chance your newbie to the community this  guy's got like the second highest amount  of subscribes man you gotta share some  of that wealth with me buddy  I would love to I'm having a hard time  getting to 10k well let me feature you  in a video right now that's alright you  guys we thank you for time take care and  we'll see you later bye  ","2":"   hey everybody welcome back     good      evening       today's Monday it was pretty I got off       work a little bit early thank      God I miss   rush hour but um actually     I want I   wanted     to do I'm gonna do a few videos       today      I want to again      crank them out so   first things first     I've been      putting   this     this this fragrance off      for a       little bit but just      because it's still   summer     I felt it's appropriate to to   make this     video because it's      even though   summer is basically over     we still have   like a good     like month or two of you   know the     the hot weather      you know sort       of speak or you know even      though it   cools down that this fragrance is from      its it's I don't      want to butcher      his   name     but our min she      uh uh a man is       mister zinnia or I put      it that way       Momo      yeah it's      a he's a      high-end if   correct me if I'm wrong      yeah Italian fashion designer and I   actually picked     this bottle      of satyr       Saturday and I saw it like a week ago       cuz I usually go to      Rack stores at least   three in three times a week     just to see   because     that's the only      way you can you   can     find hidden gems      if you're like       constantly like constantly there or   constantly going there at least     three   times a week     that's how I      get lucky   because     once something is gone from       those      rekts stores it's gone cannot go   back it's     not like you know      retail you   you     can they can      order it for you so   it's     just whatever is left over so   anyway get into this     whoa      mo      mr.      zinnia   is     great and I'm telling you      I when I   bought this fragrance it was I wasn't  familiar with     it but      I seen a few   reviews     before I purchased it but      I   there was     an open bottle   and this one's it and     this was the last       one but few weeks back      there was like   five or     six I'm telling myself oh damn   and people really know their shit     like       you know so anyway thank God there was       one because I really wanted to borrow   and buy it and     it was      $12.99 $12.99 per   I mean you can get the     100ml for      25       dollars      on      eBay      if you go on eBay      right   now you can find     it      for $25 but I didn't   want to     wait and $12.99 it's just chump   change     so it's      right it's it's      okay it's   it nowadays     2018 it's really      nothing I       mean you know it's      ten dollars      any      uh       five dollars you know so anyway      um so       dis      I sprayed it      in he was      fuckin   floored  I was like this is     the fucking       fragrances that that like why are DS is   underrated     why the hell are these   underrated why are we even talking about      than you      than you you know      like John       Paul Gucci you know the in the Navy      this       right here I      believe is can be a give it   a run     for its money   or and if not     that      even      better you know   like     or      dealer      so far as this and      that   blah blah blah     there are so many   fragrances guys and girls and whoever  watches my videos that are     fucking under   under 20     bucks      that you can buy and that   can perform has     beast      mode       performance-wise      is up      to ten out of ten       and this is one of them I have to give   it up to this     one this is basically this       twelve you cannot beat the price first       of all you      don't have to go in and      get   this this     is actually a spring and   summer so lovest spring     it's summer   fragrance so let me say     that off the bat   it's still early     to get it even      if it's       you know just stock up on it before they       discontinued it      or something because       this is amazing      I was in life and I   actually said     that those two girls in   front     of me they were together and I       just asked them you know hey      listen you       know before you know because   in this whole fragrance world     I mean      I   might     think      as something that's      good   which you know     happy well most of the   time I I know what     what's good and   what's not     and like I      said this becomes   second nature when you're in this     kind   of like collect     collecting fragrances   and     preparing this      and      it really you       know what's a hit when you know what's   not and you know what's your typical      office sent typical fragrance you know       so anyway like you know Dolce and       Gabanna      the one gray is just your   typical     I would not buy that like you   know that's one you know and     not      to      hate       on it it's just your typical it's a good   smell it's just     your typical so you know   you know I can name like at least     ten   fragrances that     are under      $20 they're   better than Dolce     &amp;amp; Gabbana gray      you       know so and and without you know       breaking the bank      but this one right   here     it just the main I'm just gonna get   into     the main Accords it's a woody its   citrus     oceanic green aromatic aquatic   smell and     I sprayed it when I got out   the     car and this is like probably      three   hours     later and it's still projecting so   like you know     it's it's a great      it's      I   can't tell you enough     I it's it's at   least a     nine out of      ten now you know if   not     ten it can flip-flop ten out of      ten   or     nine      out of ten      I highly      recommend   this one     a      very not because      of the price   it's a great fragrance     I swear I cannot   stress     this enough      how good this of a       fragrance this      is you know if you can   always when you do     these reviews yeah   like go     and look at other people like I   do it like three     or four review reviews   like you know     I watch other reviewers       you know before I make my choice      because   everybody     basically everybody on YouTube       all the      reviewers are      credible they're   very     good they know what they're      talking   about they     don't feed you bullshit or   not     so you      know      yeah   and we don't need     to and this is      just       and you know      it's it's good to go out   there and     smell them and when we      can   only say like you     know direct you to   like um to the     right path      you know but   unless you go     out there and smell them       you know usually they you know the rec   stores don't have sound     but you can   always     find like an open one or you know   what     not or      just go to Sephora I see   what you think you know but     again like   we can     just stare you the right   direction     so this one I bought it for 12       $12.99 13 but 13      something      with      some       change it's the it's the 30ml and I'll   just open it     for you great little bottle       let's say you know it's a typical bottle   it's really you know you can play     music   on     gin      the shit or something but like   let me smell it     it's it's basically       there's a few reviewers that      that hit it   on the head when they     explained this   fragrance     you      know      like you're you're in       like like a rain for a tropical   rainforest     I smell like like melon like   watermelon     mixed with honey do with with   citrus notes masculine notes     you know   it's     very green it's very aromatic woody   the the     perfect combination      i again you   know every you know     I can go on til       tomorrow talking about this fragrance   but I'm just     gonna I don't      want to drag   this video like too much     thumbs up   highly recommended highly recommended so  if you     ever have a      chance go online they   have     them online      you cannot go wrong you   get     at      least      three hours      of projection       eight hours      longevity it's a great it's   a     it's it      lasts very very long and again   you know if     I'll put it this way either   if you have     this or if you have the aqua       to Geo      \/ formal like money to shell out   for equities egos     if you only have this   you     don't that's all you

much   everybody  ","3":"   come to another fragrance quickie and  today's topic is Woma immense fragrance  by italian fashion designer anna gildo  zhenya wit published notes of bergamot  vetiver violet and cedarwood and what  could I possibly think about this one  thumbs up thumbs down yeah  I'm certainly doing this one Sephora  just got this in and I'm really glad  that I checked it out it's a fresh scent  but it's a fresh scent with its own vibe  to it  and plus it doesn't have tonka bean and  vanilla in it there's nothing wrong we  talk bean and vanilla but it's so nice  to find a new release from the designer  realm that isn't based around those  notes so I really appreciate that what  you get out of this one is the overall  feel of it  is a salty oceanic slightly metallic  Ozone feel to it now when I say salty  and oceanic I don't mean aquatic what I  mean is like salty ocean air coming at  you and in the midst of that you have  green violet you have the cedar wood in  vetiver  but they're not very pronounced their  way in the background just creating a  slight woody backdrop and there is a  slight darkness about this fragrance  created by patchouli now I get about 8  hours of this fragrance love that lasts  me all day a projection is about average  and if I were to create like a painting  a painting comes to my head when I think  about this fragrance what comes to my  head there's a man sitting on the beach  on an ocean just after a lightning storm  has happened so you got that salty sea  air coming at you the air is a little  electrically charged you know the sky is  not black it's just kind of fading away  and in the backdrop behind him there is  the woods and in front of the woods  there's violets growing so I also get  that also with this blend you do get a  touch of that bergamot flowing through  here as well it's not very loud just  adding you know a soft fruity dampness  with this blend and as far as  as far as the compliment factor goes man  this thing was through the roof I  haven't heard insane  compliments like that in a long time  this one girl didn't want to let me go  and this is one of those times that I  wish you can see their faces I mean just  the sheer pleasure on their faces from  smelling something you know that's  awesome  and there's one girl loved s she didn't  even know I'm standing next to her she  looks at me and she's like oh my god  what are you wearing today oh man just  positive feedback with that salt  absolutely love that so for me ah this  is a definite winner definitely  something that I would recommend to  check out for Shore and if you have  checked it out let me know your thoughts  on it and if you have not follow the  links down below I'm Dan makers Mich and  this is then a very exhilarating  electrifying Piggy  ","4":"   hi and welcome back to studio since I'm  Tommy you ever have one of those days  where something happens so frequently  that you begin to question whether it's  a coincidence or not like for example 3  of your favorite songs playing  back-to-back on a radio station that  doesn't play your kind of music  or does something that makes you go hmm  is it here here here I don't know I  happened to come across a fragrance that  I had heard absolutely nothing about so  I blind bought it so of course as  happens when you think you're the only  person to buy the Plum Crazy purple  Dodge Challenger and then you hop in it  and drive around you see them everywhere  literally everywhere and that's exactly  what happened with this fragrance as  soon as I bought it the fragrance was  still in the bag  Google Home Hub began playing frags to  riches gentleman was talking about  office for men and comparing it between  Dior Sauvage I believe if I can find  that I'll show you a thumbnail the Dior  Sauvage and office for men and exactly  the part where he mentions this  fragrance and I think he even went to go  get his bottle of it I actually pulled  out mine and that's when I began to see  this fragrance pop up everywhere in  people's opinions vary from that's a  complete trash to it's a great fragrance  belonging to any classic man's ensemble  which is why I've decided to give my  first impression of my blind by elderman  gildo zinnias whoa  all right so let's break into this  designer fragrance and see what we think  of woman I'm gonna get in here I always  feel like it's Christmas whenever I  start breaking into the something that  makes it wrinkling sound one thing  you'll notice about Omo is its weight I  mean if if weight we're an indicator of  quality you know you've got a quality  product with this in your hand you could  do some band damage with this thing  honestly it is extremely heavy there's  either a lot of glass there or they're  using lead as an ingredient I haven't  read anything about although I read some  first impressions of the notes that are  in this I haven't read anything about  the bottle itself oh I kind of like that  check that out Wow okay I really like  that so there's actually a tactile feel  to the bottle itself it's there's ridges  as you can hear and see and the ridges  create a really nice design on the front  and the back and through the bottle it  carries on into the lid so from plastic  to glass it carry the same Ridge design  so I do like that as you can see the  name is imprinted at the very bottom  Elmo  there's nothing on the back and on the  bottom I would say yes so you've got  your product information and your batch  code and let's see I will turn this this  side that way you could kind of see if I  can hold that Center it enough  and there's an app on the bottle so  directly from the box into my hand this  is a really nice looking presentation  the bottle is very very heavy and it's  very nice looking I like the color it's  kind of cloudy it's got kind of a  grayish so I like that it's got kind of  a mysterious air to it now let's check  out that cap the cap is also a little  curious but is really nice the cap does  click on fairly well on the very top you  can see Adam in gildo Zegna it's named  the designer on the top nothing else  though let's see let's see if it stands  the test of holding the bottle even  though that bottle is extremely heavy as  bottles go you can still hold it up by  the cap and it's not going to fall off  so that's really good now let's check  out the spray pattern or array and see  if it is just a wide cloud or if it's a  little bit more focused whoa okay Wow  I'm gonna just brace um on me right here  okay I'm getting a lot of like the first  sensation that I got was a very like  almost like you ever walk outside and in  the middle of a storm and you take a  deep breath of fresh air and you get  that kind of Stratus that ozone kind of  astringent almost like a bite to it and  we call that fresh air that's what it  kind of reminds me of just like a sea  breeze or uh it's not it's not aquatic  the first thing that came to mind was  and the image of a garden right after it  had rained and rain was falling off the  leaves of different spices and and  vegetables because it's got kind of a  earthy but then you have the garden is  hedged by dense forests so you've got  this  the woods and you've got that ozone  right out the gate  you've got the citrus there because  always a good opening or presentation  citrus does but citrus is not what  sustains or maintains shortly after  you've got a little bit of a violet leaf  going on there you've got D you  definitely have some bergamot and you've  gotta I really like how that sort of  it's strong at the opening like it and  then the violet kind of sneaks up on you  but then it just kind of drifts into a  more subdued flavor like if you were to  take a dartboard and everything but the  bullseye would represent a mass appeal  who Elmo would be that area it's very  familiar territory so it's not gonna be  anything new nothing new and exciting or  unique however I really do like what it  does with the freshness I like what it  does with the violet leaf it's a very  fresh cleansing sensation and fragrance  without the soap does that make sense it  doesn't it doesn't have the vibe of kind  of a generic soap beer a dial or sudsy  feel to it but it gives you that after  shower fresh feeling that sensation of  like a storm does washes everything  clean this is one of those fragrances  that I would safely say would be a great  blind buy for anyone there's nothing  offensive about it it does play it safe  but that's a good thing if you want  something that you can just spray on and  take off go to work or go to where  you're gonna be in tight clothes close  proximity to a lot of people you're not  gonna have to worry about alright so the  video got interrupted there in other  words I had to run out the door for  about 45 minutes and honestly it's it's  all but gone like literally some sort of  woodsy a she kind of left over but very  much skin scent so if I had to say  anything about Momo is it's awesome  opening dry down is completely gone upon  dry down almost completely gone this is  as much of a skin scent as I've  experience and designer fragrance so  you'll like even considering that I  still feel like it's a really good value  for for what you spend on it I think I  spent no more than fifteen dollars on  this 100 ml bottle and I think it's a  really elegant cool design and I think  the the fragrance itself is really nice  you've got that set cedar and that  vetiver balance and that bergamot  working together but more than anything  I really like the bite of ozone and and  that the kind of a green earthy bite  that this has at the very beginning this  does have a citrus in the opening but  again I think that's superseded by the  the green and the kind of a stringent  aroma in this which kind of sets it  apart to a degree but again it's it  doesn't last hardly at all heck if this  was your go-to you would run through  this bottle and I would say six months  to two a year probably less that is an  impressive weight if you were to drop  this on your big toe I guarantee you the  neighbors would know well that's it for  my first impression of wool mo I really  like it it's definitely a skin scent  something you can wear it to the office  something you can wear around the house  you can wear around your friends it's a  play it safe very subtle fragrance but I  do really like that ozone that earthy  green the bergamot and vetiver and the  cedar working really well together with  the citrus in the opening and in the mid  there is absolutely nothing left on the  dry down however so very much as skin  sent something to consider but at the  price if I were you I definitely  recommend grabbing it up and adding it  to your collection thank you so much for  joining me today with my first  impression of Omo my name is Tommy with  studio since and I'll see you next time  [Music]  ","5":"   what's going on guys so today's video I  have not done any video like this for  quite some time probably been like four  or five months at the very least now  today we're actually gonna be doing a  top five from a designer house ie I did  like a top five creed I did a top 5  perry ellis you know ferrari but I  haven't done a house that's very  underrated and today we're gonna be  doing top 5 best Zegna fragrances so I  personally really do like Zegna they're  probably like one of my they are in my  top 3 favorite companies out there but  my problem with zania is that a lot of  the fragrances they tend to be  discontinued easily or they're just  limited time offer you know I Zegna  what's going on you know you produce  some amazing fragrances I wish that you  would keep them but this list is in no  particular order  fragrance number one unfortunately this  one is discontinued I have to blind buy  it off eBay and it didn't cost me a  pretty penny and I'm gonna butcher this  name but it's Zegna aqua the state  summer fragrance so there is this one  and a blue one now with this one some of  the notes again you get a grapefruit  pepper mint Murrah cardamom and musk  what I get is that I definitely get like  a spicy like a spicy oriental a spicy  aquatic daytime casual type of scent now  with the name summer in it and just the  color of the bottle you would assume  that this is more of a summertime  fragrance you can work with in the  summer time but I find that this is more  ideal in the springtime when it's so  warm not hot  but not cool just just right when it's  like a little bit warm but not humidity  or anything like that it's a great scent  that's unfortunate discontinued and  again zania what are you doing you gotta  bring these this stuff back man I did do  a video on this one with Gary from  no-nonsense so I'm gonna attach that  link in whatever video that I have done  on these fragrances down below some  number two is a great winter phrase that  I'm not sure if it's discontinued  whenever I do go into a Zegna boutique I  don't see it but you're  able to get it very easily off line on  some of these discounters but this is  Zenga Forte so you get honey tobacco you  get tonka bean what's pink pepper  different citruses and lavender this is  pretty much our mommy code with honey I  have said this countless times whether I  have mentioned this fragrance but there  it's not 100% light code but it  certainly goes along that Avenue so with  this one I got a lot of tobacco I get  tonka bean I've got a really smooth  sweet silky honey and there is like  maybe like a faint leather cord in this  one this one has like a mysterious vibe  but it's like a gentleman sent it has  sexy pee like you can wear this from  dressing down to a night out to a suit  and tie and it only costs you no more  than $25 USD senate number three was it  blinded by from ebay because hey that's  how the seigneur all right discontinued  a lot of their gems but this one here is  zagnut zi fresh with this one you get  juniper berries grapefruit musk woody  notes and cardamom but those are the  only notes to this one so with this one  you definitely get a lot of the the  juniper berries along with some the  citruses and it pretty much dries down  to like a woody musky base I really do  like this one the bottle itself the  covering is what I don't like about it  is that this tends to come off quite  easily so when I haven't lying in my bag  you know it just goes up quite quite  easily that's probably like my only  downfall with this one also with it  being discontinued but it smells great  it's just a casual day-to-day fragrance  that you can wear it like which is a  white t-shirt and jeans but also to work  it's not a serious suit I type of scent  but it's a great work scent but just a  day where you're just kicking back and  relaxing scent number four this isn't  definitely a gentleman's fragrance that  I find can be unisex it is marketed  towards the men just like I think zaniel  only does men's stuff anyways but this  certainly is a unisex scent to my nose  and this is Zegna Zini lon fig Santa  wood and Clary sage are the only notes  listed you get a lot of Clary sage and  fig notes with  a nice creamy sandalwood this is  certainly a gentlemen's type of  fragrance that you can wear dressing  down to something formal it's more of a  daytime type of scent not an evening  scent but this smells fantastic I have  had max 40 in Rena less and smileys  fragrances and they said that this  pretty much is like a niche type of  scent in a designer bottle I ended up  blind by this one I blind bought a lot  of Zegna fragrances this was one of my  best ones when it comes to the name of  the city Milan there's actually Chu as  you get in New York and you get Shanghai  this is the best of the three on but  when I bought mine like a year and a  half ago two years ago it was easily out  there but I unfortunately like fragments  ex Pregnant's net or any of these other  online discounters it's a little bit  harder to come by but look because this  is a cheapy and a goodie especially if  you like fake notes and the last  fragments in this video we're gonna have  to go with their upper line they're  designer luxury line email image endo is  zina Sicilian Mandarin so with this  again of course the name is Sicilian  Mandarin you get oak Moss bergamont pity  green and mint this really does smell  very natural it's a great spring but  mostly summertime type of fragrance you  could dress this one down to dressing it  up I would not wear this like a tuxedo  but certainly a a suit and tie to like a  t-shirt jeans and just like runners you  know this is a phenomenal set that's  most natural  it's a Happy's se uplifting type of  fragrance that really does put me in a  good mood whenever I smell this one if  you like aromatherapy and you got that  coin to spend because this ain't she  this is a great citrus based scent so  anyway that is my top 5 a Zegna  fragrances what are some of the favorite  fragrances from zinnia that you like you  know some fragrances that may not have  made this list I got an easily made a  top 10 but I wanted to limit this to a  top of 5  so whatever frankenz reviews I have done  on this they will be listed down below  the only one that I have not done is  this one here but this one will be  review  eventually so guys you liked this video  please give it a big thumbs up share the  video subscribe to if you haven't hit  that notification mouse we think of your  time take care and we'll see you later  ","6":"   [Music]  good what is up welcome to another  episode of Maximilian must know today  we're reviewing one from the house of  Hermes ildo zhenya and this one is going  to be called normal now this is the  second set I'm reviewing from the house  of zhenya I also review review Peruvian  and Brett from their Essenza collection  I love that set and I actually own a lot  more fragrance from zhenya I own that  absolute version of Walmart and I will  review that at some point down the road  there's more I'd like to buy for the  right price I feel like the best for me  a sense a line is Japanese patchouli and  I will get that one day it might be my  favorite patchouli scent that I've tried  and I'm also need to check out that  essence spice and elements of man  collection and even the gold collection  I smelled none of that if you want Zegna  backstory please don't check out the  video that I did a Peruvian M breath to  learn more about this wonderful Italian  house that just makes gorgeous gorgeous  clothing this fragrance is a 2013  release with notes of citrus Calabrian  bergamot violet leaf Bennifer and cedar  pretty simple right I got my 30ml bottle  from Nordstrom wrapped for $33 probably  overpaid a little bit if you're looking  for this you can find a hundred ml on  fragrance net for $22 so I definitely  overpaid isn't worth it for you to pick  in that up we'll talk about it so as far  as your presentation goes on a 30ml it's  real basic you just have Zen wall mo  here you have the Zegna name there give  a little sticker on the bottom and your  sprayer pretty basic but works well  again this is the 30ml bottle so it's  the mini the larger ones are just sort  of bigger sizes of this and you have  this sort of  you know these these lines that that  come out of the bottle so gives it some  texture presentation to me is this fine  on this one uh it's a really nice  fragrance you don't have like some  fragrances there's like 20 notes and you  can maybe pick up like five this  obviously has a smaller note breakdown  but I'd be pretty surprised if someone  couldn't pick up everything that's going  on and hear all the notes that they  mentioned you're gonna get this citrus  accord at the top that relies very  heavily on bergamot that's mixed with a  very green violet leaf note its a bright  scent tempered by woods and green notes  because you have the middle and base of  this fragrance built on a soapy vetiver  and a warming cedar now it's really  quite nice I like this home that I  bought it and as you can see I've worn  it quite often the mix and the violet  and the Bennifer with the cedar is  unique and it makes it to me at least  quite a step up from other designer  sense certainly in this price range if  you think you're just getting some good  quality here with this fragrance now  again it's not super complex but it's a  good high quality simplicity that I  personally find to be very appealing  it's also a competent performer as one  goes about eight hours with about six  hours of projection there's some C OSH  here it's not loud but it's there and  you'll notice it as well others I again  I feel like I say this all the time but  but anyone can wear whatever they like I  feel like this one was just clearly  marketed towards men and will probably  do better but certainly wouldn't be out  of place on a woman ideally this is a  great office sent for the springtime but  I actually think you could get away with  this one in any season winter included  that woody base with the vetiver makes  this one smell quite clean and it's  never wrong to smell clean with that  said this is gonna do better for you in  the springtime if someone were to out  well first let's actually talk about if  you can't get your hands on this and  you're looking for something so  what you might do you know violet leaf  is always going to give you get give  Fahrenheit comparisons but for a men's  designer that is this is a like would be  a much more incomplete version of that  I'd say it's a little bit more like well  Fahrenheit  but I find this to be fairly unique now  I do have to admit what comes closest to  this and it's it's fairly close it's why  I sell loan Libre the kalam tonic  version and the original but this is  going to be pretty significantly less  expensive than both of those options now  if someone we're trying to talk you into  purchasing this fragrance I think they  tell you that it's got a great smell  it's not expensive it's an office sense  a great office setting you know not  everyone wears this so you're gonna pee  oh you're gonna be feeling pretty unique  when you got this one up I think on the  flip side when we're trying to get you  to skip this one they tell you that it's  just not gonna doing one's cup of tea  it's distinct and there's probably some  better options from Zegna certainly from  their earlier stuff if you can find  those or sometimes harder to to find to  me this is a 7 out of 10 I really enjoy  this fragrance I just think it's got  that Italian simplicity and Italian  simplicity I always refer to cooking  where my one of my friends is mother is  a group just the excellent cook from  Italy and when she makes a dish she sort  of says like ok once you go past three  ingredients that's too many you know  like you want like very simple seasoning  just use really good high quality  ingredients and you don't have to dump  it add in 50 things and I feel like that  Italian simplicity with high quality  materials that's great when you when you  get that no matter what whether it be  fragrance or art or you know anything  where your senses are involved and I  think this is actually a really good job  of that for that price point this is  really well made it's cheap and it  smells good it's hard to beat that but  you might not love it if you're not a  violently fan but if you are a violently  fan I feel like you have to at least  give this one a look  and the surpassed that there's been my  review of wall mobizen yeah I would love  to hear what others think if you try  this do you think it's a hidden gem I  really don't hear a lot about this I  think it's pretty good so let me know if  you think I'm my own ear  if you've ever given this a try for  something that interests you leave a  comment let me know of course I try to  answer them when I can and take guys  I'll see you soon again with more videos  my name  [Music]  ","7":"   hey guys Shannon here with another  review this time I'm going to be giving  you two fragrances in one video I'm  actually doing a read with a remake of  this fragrance I did it last night I  wasn't too happy I don't have the  bottles I got some samples when I did a  recent purchase I got a whole whack of  samples it's kind of funny when you when  you ask for a sample when you go to most  stores up here they say oh we don't have  any but when you buy something they  enclose a whole wacom anyways some of  you guys might roll your eyes when I  reveal the name it's all good it's uh  okay swallow my pride right here Adam  Levine for him yes Adam Levine from  maroon 5 I went through the bottle the  last night when I was doing a review I  actually broke the bottle so that's the  reason why I'm redoing it so yeah  there's the broken bottle so yeah okay  let's get this started  alright so it was launched this year in  2013 the Noah's behind it is a yen best  name it's described as a woody aromatic  man the chords are citrus fresh spicy  sorry fresh spicy fresh fruity and  tropical definitely has that tropical in  that fruity feel top notes are mandarin  orange and grapefruit which is very  strong and very apparent in the opening  lemongrass sage and violet leaf mid  notes are passion fruit guava and ginger  the base is cedar wood sandalwood and  amber I remember a few years ago a lot  of people were complaining about Dolce &amp;amp;  Gabana the one having really poor  performance issues well this one is even  worse this lasted like longevity was  two-three hours max after three hours  it's pretty much gone hell even after  like pretty much two hours it's pretty  much gone projection and our 90 minutes  you know it's really bad quality but  celebrity fragrances are not known for  quality that the celebrity for the most  part just goes in gets a quick buck and  there you go I remember watching a few  reviews on this stating that Adam Levine  said on his Twitter or something that he  thinks that all celebrities shouldn't  get into the fragrance game and just let  it go but apparently he's a kind of I  guess he's backpedaling or going against  his own words the one positive thing  that I will say about this fragrance is  that it's different  um that tropical and that fruity vibe I  really like it's not your typical citrus  colognes it's very different but I keep  like I cannot picture an older person  such as myself wearing this I think in  all honesty 20 and under you know this  is an OK fragrance I think this is maybe  for the tweens like I really don't know  like even if this lasted you know I had  good performance you know you would get  your you know let's say five six hours  it's not a fragrance for someone in my  age you know it's super casual it's  summer it's pretty much yeah you know  like I I'm not into celebrity fragrances  but the one that I actually do enjoy and  that's actually not bad is Tim McGraw  southern blend that's actually a pretty  nice one you know I don't really  recommend this one and like you're  pretty much wasting your money on the  piss-poor quality like Shoppers Drug  Mart sells this for I think was sixty  plus dollars they didn't sell us in any  retailers but the pharmacies fragrance  net sells us for forty dollars but  you're still paying like you're  overpaying for something that's really  bad right so that's my review of that  one so hopefully uh well you laughs or  whatnot so yeah that's a broken glass  and  the second one is actually a better  house at it actually gets summer love  and that is from Zegna its Zegna LUMO  now the tester went through the whole  bottle this is not a bad variance  typical Cologne of advertisements you  know it's always got your guy and  sometimes an attractive woman standing  next to them  the bottle is pretty swanky I kind of  like it it kind of looks like a like a  like an expensive cigarette holder like  sorry I got a lighter but even before  that guy like a holder to carry your  cigarettes so it was launched this year  it's considered a woody aromatic menos  are woody citrus aromatic green and  ozone 'ok top notes are bergamot  citruses violently betta burr in cedar i  didn't know what mo mo meant I'd really  don't know how the pronunciation but  thanks to Raj for clearing for a  clarifying it is actually man for time  it's in Italian this is a pretty good  all your fragrance it's it's not strong  it's not in your face it's clean it's  crisp it's you know it's it's nice right  it's it's great for the office great  signature scents it's it's okay for  dates you know it's I don't think it's  formal it's Zegna has a bit of a stylish  house a little bit but this fragrance  kind of reminds me of Lumley pate by  Yves saying that it's very close then I  don't know about the notes but just the  smell itself really reminds me of yummy  but it like it do I recommend it yeah  the longevity is moderate projection is  it's not long it's not doesn't like I  said this is not an in-your-face  fragrance but I think I would get  anywhere from three to three-and-a-half  so if you want something that's gonna  slap you in the face  and last a long time this is definitely  not it you know for it comes in your two  standard bottles fifty and a hundred ml  and they range from sixty to eighty five  dollars Canadian so yes that is my  review of both Adam Levine for him and  Zegna LUMO so I hope you liked oh sorry  I almost forgot this fragrance could be  used by an aged so from your eighteen  year olds to your much mature  grandfather so yeah alright guys that is  it Senya  Omo Adam Levine for him thanks for  watching please rate comment and  subscribe and I will see you guys later  peace  ","8":"    sections of lately welcome to me    channel today I bring you a video of a top    of fragrances

sweet hero from his exit radiating    freshness radiates splendor radiates peace    radiates a feeling of having a scent    delicious in your skin I can also    feel the fragrance as if it were a    touch of neroli with cucumber we know    that cucumber is famous when in    summer climates is used a lot the    cucumber here I'm sorry with a way out    of cucumber with citrus and although it doesn't have    the cucumber    what gives that feeling is a note    that soon I will be saying it and    it gives you the expectation that it is a    fragrance that is very exclusive for    people in italy people in    Italy use this fragrance very much    because it is of very good quality and is    also designed what is with bergamot    from Italy is a fragrance that goes in    perform a lot on citrus touches of    wood a little pink for that touch    of wood and citron that it has but not    both a floral touch made in the    year 2018 lemon bergamot january the neroli    and if priaulx the cypress is that note that    one will feel as if smelling cucumber the    fragrance with the touch of neroli that is    relatively is what is achieved    perceive from the beginning is not one of those    citrus fragrances that hardly lasts is    an average citrus fragrance I can    say that it lasts me approximately    six hours in an intense summer weather    so the fragrance is not so bad    for six hours we know that    fragrances in climates    [Music]    strong summer and cyclic    we almost didn't get a performance    as it should be but with choosing them    already in water money read if we are going to    find at least six hours and one    wake that will be moderated    pitifully one would like this    kind of aromas that give you freshness that    have israel vazquez radiate a    very rich feeling of cold feeling of    citrus sensation in your body would last    up to twelve hours but it costs a lot    develop them so here been idol is    a very good option for people    who like to have a pretty scent    intense to a touch of citrus    Accompanied as a cucumber aroma    the next fragrance we are talking    of emerged signar acqua di bergamo everything    is your presentation indicate and yes it is    true that is the same presentation    because there is a pretty existence line    of what is ram water lee    right now squeeze motorcycle    let's try this fragrance this is    another fragrance that I like    I've tried it a lot but don't use it    an atomization    what I find this fragrance    very different from neroli is that the level    neroli is much more vibrant since the    start and it is much richer to perceive it    from the start    unlike really motorcycle that from the    start can be considered a bit    synthetic but it evolves when it goes    accepting right now it's drying up a bit and    that's where she started to feel a    fragrance with some fresh touches and some    marine touches but what I know most    root the fragrance is going to be citrus    floral a little aromatic notes what    marine and a fresh touch I don't feel that    the fragrance have some darkness in    she simply the beginning is a bit    confusing because all those mixtures the    they make like a star like a note or a    fragrance area from the beginning then    you can make the start you don't like it    but give it a chance and let    dry to perceive that delicious aroma    that I will feel in me    staff I like a little more neroli    because sense because it is more natural and    the fragrance is much fresher and much    more radiant    before the start motorcycle cock stays    like a shy fragrance and it can be    half an hour then half an hour and    start developing then we have    a period where the fragrance plays a    substantial time in us where    we say yes we say no and we already    we know that we are people that we decide    we will go fast when acquiring    a fragrance if the first impression or    the first the first atomization has    the expectation that you liked one you    acquires but here it is difficult it is difficult    with water di bergamo pto because I can't achieve    feel those glittering notes from the    start I just feel a stir from    notes as something something fragrance    contains bergamot citrus notes    floral and marine notes I can    fully perceive yes but it is a    fragrance that is not linear we already know    that starts very shy and very sour and    then and the citrus touch begins and the    Bergamot touch and floral touch    I can't feel it from the beginning    that the touch the floral comes felt    in spite of already spending three hours and what    sailor definitely    spanair lasts me approximately too    6 hours a moderate wake    mainly for use in weather    summer mgl dozen quads and bergamot    next fragrance and here it has been brought    a fragrance that is economical and that    I should acquire what I am the    We will put this fragrance cowgirl though    be difficult to understand from the    start and i'm talking about mer gildo    zegna guamo this is a presentation    also 1.5 ml and what I like about this    fragrance is that because of its aroma that is not    very common    and that the beginning is quite we can    say another world is a fragrance of    third dimension a bit difficult to    understand a little hard to abide by    those notes that the fragrance possesses and by    therefore leads to being a fragrance that    it remains hidden in the world of    the perfumery but you have to take out the light    choosing them in fertilizer is a fragrance    economic that we can find very    easily in department stores in    Amazon Eribe at a great price and has    very high quality first the    fragrance gives me a feeling of a    modern classic fragrance and what to me    I like that citrus touch and    dawned he possesses and the fragrance has    a sonic tango environment and accompany it    green notes that one stays    impressed after that we achieved    find fragrance with aquatic notes    and a very aromatic fragrance but what    main citrus    the sonic and the aromatic that what I    I perceive this fragrance and that in reality    captivates my smell delicious    what brings this fragrance to life are    certain notes that you have have notes that    they are captivating because it has violet the    vetiver and cedar    those three notes are the three notes that    they reduce this fragrance and they do    have the distinction of any    fragrance mix violet with vetiver is    a spectacular feeling the vetiver    only as comfort vetiver today and not of    have we know that it is a fragrance that to    some like others dislike    but most of us know that it is a    very good fragrance but mix that    vetiver with violet leaves are going to    get this and at a price quite like    30 dollars 100 ml then to    comparison of what they are are for organ    out of you see we know it's a    fragrance as linear with a touch of    pretty mature vetiver and we    we want to have or like that fragrance    and if you like comfort and I turn from you see    this fragrance you will love the ine    in the violet sorry very good    enriching in this fragrance and without    action in won 2013 and it's been    hidden in several collections and    even hidden in stores    departmental for those who do not    they know now that you know her    I invite you to give it a    test and apply leave it think    at home they will perceive perceive    they feel it and they will realize that    It is a very rich or sonic fragrance    very evolutionary and above all that lasts    pretty good 8 hours emergildo sana    how does that have that point in favor    for us that has a very long duration    good and a price like 30 dollars the    100 mn chosen on the web and finally    we have az in this is another fragrance    that many speak in groups but that    few youtubers bring it out in the    world of mushroom fragrance videos    senna is a fragrance that in you is    I can quite say that it is a color    bluish    much more than that we will not atomize    here on the wrist    [Music]    to me the beginning of this fragrance is me    makes as a common fragrance and    current but it doesn't stop there isn't that    I am giving him a bad position    the fragrance is common for    my nose the beginning the beginning that    approximately has about 15 minutes of    contemplate drying after that the    fragrance starts its magic that common    we disappear like changing a sheet    of a book and we come back with a    totally magical fragrance and we are going to    find a very fresh fragrance a    special touch a touch of wood already    despite that a very aromatic fragrance    launched in 2005 a fragrance that    contains notes of nutmeg rosemary    the touch of iris the pepper and a touch    of patchouli so the fragrance shines    with quite rich notes and    enriching in the world of    perfumery and in tol fatto and that's why it    becomes a fragrance that after    drying becomes a jewel in the world of    the perfumery but pitifully remains    how sad the fragrance and the sense of    that is not going to project so much that if the    fragrance lasts about 8 hours and    is left with a projection as shy    but if you project in climates that I can    but yes    better in summer climates there are people    who use it at night is fine not    I deny but the summer weather I feel that    It is the best option to use    tasigna because that's where he    I encourage the development of the fragrance    so that we have a distinctive aroma and    the projection will get better so    both the life of this fragrance is the    rosemary touches the touch of iris and that    patchouli touch that has a certain path    it lasts me we already know approximately 89    hours a moderate wake between more    heat makes the fragrance is much more    spectacular accept dinner and friends    any question of these four    beautiful fragrances write me below    I will gladly answer many    thanks and see you later    [Music]   ","9":"   sup guys y'all know who this is  it's your boy let me get connected here  [Music]  me a second guys alright so I see you  only got one person in here if you can  hear me let me know cuz I'm not sure if  this thing is connected I think it is  but if you can okay cool alright so this  is something someone asked me about a  couple of days ago and I was kind of  confused about what they was talking  about and they finally made it clear  what it was that they were asking about  and this one is if I'm pronouncing it  right Cigna or Zegna Cuomo and I'm  pretty sure you know what this is when  you see the bottle I actually purchased  this one from TJ Maxx and I was just  curious as to what this was about when I  saw it usually when I purchase stuff  like this it's either because TJ Maxx or  Ross or wherever I'm at they always are  out of good stuff or they have stuff and  it's just too  a highly priced in my opinion for  discount store so I purchased this one  and I think I'm not for certain but I  think the price tag was and my phone  wanna act retarded online they have it  for twenty five is twenty four ninety  eight for three point four one point  seven is fourteen twenty seven I think I  paid about fifteen or twenty bucks for  this if I'm not mistaken at t.j.maxx but  I did watch a few reviews on it and it  seemed like it was okay something that I  would like I purchased it and I'm gonna  be completely honest with you when I  first bought this and sprayed it I  didn't like it  I was kind of disappointed in it and as  you can see I've had this probably about  I want to say about a little over a year  and you see how much juice I didn't use  that it is that's hardly anything I  think I used it once and I didn't use it  again but I revisited it not too long  ago just you know sometimes I just go to  my collection and I pick up stuff that I  haven't worn in a while and I might  spray a little bit smell it this thing  is amazing I've been given enough credit  I've watched some more reviews and  actually I just watched joy I mean on my  ride home from work and listen to him  give his top 15 summertime fragrances  and this actually was in his list and it  gave me the notion that I don't remember  exactly who the person was who was who  was asking about this I'm sorry if I  don't remember but it gave me the notion  to go ahead and put this video out so  here it is Zegna normal  so I don't have the box of course I  never really keep boxes right now the  ones on my dresser are all almost all in  boxes because I don't have another shelf  but this is the bottle presentation and  I kind of like this bottle it's pretty  cool it's a pretty tall bottle I'm not  gonna this is 100 mil 3.4 ounce so yeah  it looks kind of bigger than 100 mil but  that's what it is hundred mil bottle I  don't know if you can hear that it has  like little grooves or lines along the  sides and well the front in the back not  on the sides it's actually on the top  also  so glass bottle but it's a plastic top  it does snap into place it will hold but  I never recommend it because you never  know what will happen just says warm Oh  here at the bottom has a sticker with  information on the bottom and that's  about it it says whatever that first  name is Cigna I ain't even free to try  to pronounce that but if you can see it  that's what it is atomizer this thing  actually smells really really nice give  me a piece of this my testers as I like  to call them it's pretty good this is a  great spring and summertime fragrance is  it's bright citrusy kind of aquatic and  I'm trying to trick you all right now  because as I'm smelling this I'm  actually glancing over at my at my phone  so if it sounds like I know what I'm  talking about I'm just read  off my screen right here but it is very  very nice I like this  yeah I never you rarely ever ever ever  will catch me holding a fragrance by the  top I'm sorry that that happened to you  homie and I've heard a lot of good  things about Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch or  Fitch how do you say it I want to look  into some of those fragrances the ones  I've seen online are kind of pricey and  I think I seen a store when I was in  Savannah but I'm not sure if it was a  clothing store or do they sell  fragrances in the in the clothing store  also if you know let me know because  I'll go back to that story and see what  kind of fragrances they have okay that's  cool okay so they do sell fragrances in  this store so I'm gonna have to go back  and check them out too but this thing is  really really nice guys I was wasn't  impressed when I first bought it but you  know you know how sometimes when you buy  a fragrance or you test the fragrance we  usually guess colognes I have one guest  alone  and hold on  this is the only guest cologne that I  have it's okay it's not it's not  groundbreaking or nothing like that I  think I wore this maybe once my top  didn't want to hurt there for a second  it smells nice it's just not  long-lasting enough for me but this one  is very nice you know what now that you  just said that  I just called myself a liar caught  myself in a lie because I have this one  also I'm sorry about that on me I have  this one I seen the blue one and this  thing is dusty I've seen the blue one  I think they sell it for like ten or  fifteen dollars and I've seen it at Ross  and TJ Maxx and I just never purchased  it but I may need to because you just  brought it up I like this bought this  one I liked it a lot but as you can see  I've never worn it I just bought it and  it sits on my shelf and collects dust  but this one I need to get back to this  one so let me get through with this  because whoever the guy was who asked  about this one I want to give him this  because I am a man of my word and I try  to keep my word when you guys comment  and leave suggestions and ask questions  and stuff like that I want to try to be  as consistent as possible and get you  guys what you asked for so this is it so  I didn't like this one at first but as I  kept seeing reviews and people talk  about it and now that summer in spring  rolling back around people are breaking  out those freshies and this is one of  those freshies and i actually if I don't  wear something new tomorrow I may just  wear this one let me give you some notes  so this was released in 2013 and it says  it is a woody aromatic men's cologne  with citrus woody osanic green aquatic  and aromatic Maine Accords best for  spring and summer day where this  fragrance has moderate longevity and  cyllage it blends fragrance notes of  bergamot violet leaves citruses vetiver  and cedar this scent is this scent was  signed by  humor alberto marilla's that's pretty  much all they have as far as notes so as  you can see this thing is great for  spring and summer as I say it it's a  freshie does have some woody Accords to  it a little bit of wood which is the  cedar in it but I mostly get the green I  get the citrus and the aquatic I like it  I can't remember the longevity on this  how many hours or the projection how  many hours but when I wear this again  I'll let you know on my skin rather cuz  what works for me might not work for you  what lasts for me might not last for you  and vice versa so I think this is a  pretty solid fragrance for a cheapy  actually I'm glad I have this and the  way this bottle looks I'm gonna have  this forever I may even be able to pass  this on to my son and he might be able  to pass it on to his son if he ever has  any kids so anyway sorry it took me so  long to get this video out I know me and  his guy talked about this and he got a I  hope he didn't get frustrated with me  cuz I actually thought he was talking  about Ferragamo Romo is what I thought  he was talking about and he wasn't  talking about that but I think he was  talking about this one cuz these are I  believe the only two or moles I have  besides Moschino  or mosquito who although I have that one  yeah I teach a bags man it's suspect  right now I teach it makes and Rawls and  I can throw bills in there to is suspect  right now man after Christmas they don't  have anything like it's the same old  guess Michael Jordan adidas  some other crap that I've never heard of  I look up the notes on it and I can't  find anything on some of them fragrances  I just don't want to waste my time or my  money on some of those fragrances most  of the time I buy fragrances I do  strikeout if I can't find notes on  certain things but for the most part  mostly everything I have is pretty  decent while I got a few people on here  let me give y'all a quick tour of my  collection those of you who haven't seen  it and God that excuse my dress up  because as you can see it's ridiculous  those are all my fragrances except for  what's on my shelf over there  but this section right here is mostly  all the cheap-ass that y'all didn't  see me talk about I was trying to find  something was like blue de Chanel and I  started buying these cheapies from like  City trends for like $5 to to $10 some  of them do smell like blue de Chanel but  they just like 30 minutes or 30 seconds  later they don't last at all this one  actually smells pretty good it's  actually a kettle  as you can see it smells real good it  kind of smells like Invictus too but it  just doesn't last long what I do have a  real don't sit head judge me guys don't  I know y'all going y'all probably  sitting over there laughing at me right  now like this clown with this but let me  show you so you won't think I'm  you guys this is Invictus intense the  real deal  Paco Rabanne it's kind of hard to see  but this is the real deal so I do have  the real one I don't I want the original  Invictus but a co-worker of mine has it  and I don't want to wear the same  fragrance that he wears so I just stuck  with the intense I do want to get the  aqua version but it's kind of pricey  right now so I am gonna get it this one  actually is a bootleg copy of CH man  they tried as you can see skin for men  fire and tonic I actually didn't go with  that one it smells good but let me show  you the one I did go with and this is a  nice aquatic fragrance if you find this  one cedar and salts port it's in the  same kind of bottle as the fire and  tonic this thing is amazing it's a great  aquatic it kind of puts me in the mind  frame of stuff like Bulgari aquamarine  as you all know this is a classic  nautical voyage I have set sail  Martinique which is another great one  and I have Saint Barts which is another  great one  so all the doors are nice fragrances man  what else do I get what a joke  a venture this is supposed to be  inspired by Creed and this smells  nothing like I've never smelt Aventis  but I'm pretty sure it won't smell like  this this is the bottle they tried kind  of looks a little but it smells nothing  like fine Apple it smells it just smells  cheapest and not only pays like  four or five dollars for this crap  and I'm actually trying to get rid of  these fragrances I'm trying to give them  away but another laughingstock this is  supposed to be a bootleg version of  jean-paul Gaultier and this is  jean-pierre j-man  yeah car swag all the way though I feel  you this is one that came from the  Dollar Tree that smells like blue  Deschanel and it didn't last long it  lasted probably thirty minutes or hour  and that was trash a good friend of mine  gave me this one for my birthday  this is CEO and if you don't know what  CEO is supposed to stand for  boss CEO Hugo Boss supposed to be a  clone of a boss fragrance this actually  smells good and it actually lasts lasted  a pretty decent amount of time on my  skin so I'm not knocking this one even  though it is a cheap II don't buy this  one this is penthouse influential it  sucks to the highest of sucks tivity as  beavis and butt-head would say  yeah it was cheap I just me personally I  didn't like it it just doesn't it it  don't smell like anything to my nose to  me it sucks  I bought maximum for 25 bucks that was a  waste of money that's not strong  enough for me it's too light doesn't  last long at all I wish I could get my  $25 back these were surprisingly good  David Beckham signature and instinct I  love both of these I haven't worn them  yet but that was a great gift set I  spent 12 bucks on this let's see as you  already know as you can see right here I  have some scented oils I rarely wear  those because I started getting into  colognes I have the Paco Rabanne this is  one that my friend bought the other  night that I've been it's been eluding  me for so long I smelled this one time  before and fell in love with it and  every time I tried to get it at a decent  price it always sold so my friend bought  it and she actually paid like 60  something dollars for this so I  appreciate that now I finally have it in  my collection beautiful fragrance if you  don't have it  this one

this on  I went got my license renewed and I was  on my way to my job just to you know  walk around and show off and I walked  into the State Patrol office and two  beautiful young ladies were at the  counter and they were talking about me  and asking what I was what I had on  where was I going who was I trying to  impress and then their supervisor came  from way in the back from her office  where the door was closed and she said  she wanted to know who was smelling so  good in her Lobby and then I went to  work and people were also going crazy if  that doesn't tell you enough about this  fragrance it's a pretty good cheapy I  think it's between 15 and 20 some are  dollars but it's kind of hard to catch  it at times on fragrance X or any of  those websites because it sells out fast  I think I bought this one from our local  mall because we have one of those  middle-eastern type guys in the store  now that sells fragrances and I bought  this from him this thing is amazing man  if you don't have it you need to get it  it smells real real good trust me you  can't go wrong with tracing the weak  very nice  so that's pretty much yeah you need this  one in your life on me trust me if you  don't buy anything else that I showed  you that you may not know of in my  collection you got to get this one trace  in a week what it looks like in the box  and I got this wrong if you don't have  this one this is what it looks like now  and I'm not when our mouths started  starting popping the first one I ever  purchased was club Dave and we intense  man which is another great fragrance I  ended up falling in love with our moth  especially when Tana and then I got  Derby Clubhouse gold and then I bought  the rest of the ones I just showed you  all month make some pretty good clones  not everything they make is good though  and most of the time they're kind of  redundant if they make tracing that we  then they'll turn around and make  something else in a different bottle but  it's the same juice from Troy stressing  the week so that's kind of lame but  anyway you know people got to make money  some kind of way but if y'all got any  questions about any other fragrance oh  this one is surprising to me two to one  to VIP men this is a private party and  why see I bought this one the other day  from Big Macs sale and this thing smells  amazing so if you don't have that one  pink that 102 and this was actually a  blind by I mean I did look the notes up  on it but it was really a blind buy and  when I busted open on that review I did  a couple of days ago you can see my room  I was surprised so anyway this turned  out to be a pretty long video guys and I  need to call my friend back cuz she did  call and I didn't answer so I'm with you  two guys up tomorrow and let you know  what I'm wearing y'all have a great  night  ","10":null,"11":"   what up guys welcome back to my YouTube  channel and today I'm going to do a  review for you and if you're new to this  channel go ahead and subscribe down a  little and stay tuned for some future  videos today I'm gonna do a review to  you by um the fragrance is called Sigma  in pencil and um basically I just got  this about I say I want to go and I've  been actually testing it out here and  there so I'm gonna go ahead and run down  my notes for you and let you know what I  think about this fragrance and I'm also  gonna introduce my wife in this video  I'm gonna get hurt opinion about this  fragrance of course you get my opinion  you get my thoughts and what I think  about this fragrance and if it's  gorgeous if it's sexy or what season is  good for but also I thought you would  also be interested in the woman's  opinion so my wife is actually um very  honest about the fragrance of where she  will tell me if a fragrance that I'm  wearing doesn't smell too good even if  it's a fragrance absolutely love so  she's on a percent truthful and again if  you're new to my channel you know I'm a  hundred percent about the truth I don't  tell you what you want to hear but what  you want to know you know my motto  so again subscribe and is getting to it  right here we have Cigna in 10 so I'm  really not a fan of the bottle to me it  it looks like a glass deodorant it's  kind of shaped like a doughnut but it's  glass  you have Ridgid lining around the bottle  nothing going in the back pretty plain  you have Sigma and tensile in at the  bottom and as for the cap again looks  like a deal rent cap hard plastic now  I'm not really a fan of bottles there's  a lot of bottles out there that are  really actually classy or really cool  but I don't really care about the bottle  it's a juice that I care for now um I do  get a lot of people telling me this  fragrance  reminds them of a popular fragrance out  in the fragrance community and that is  actually to me I kind of agree with them  I think it's an identical um sit to what  I'm about to tell you it smells a  hundred percent exactly like it and the  fragrance I'm talking about is Armani  coat not perform old original like I've  mentioned this fragrance in a couple of  my videos I'm starting to hype it up  because it deserves it I think it smells  gorgeous much exactly like Armani coat I  will get into the performance and the  longevity in this one but absolutely  first presentation there you go Sigma  and tinsel now I've been wearing this  for a while now and I think it's more  suitable for a a date night or it's also  it's also suitable for for if you work  in the office or if you're working  um in a closed environment it's  especially especially for the offices I  think it's absolutely gorgeous and it's  one of my favorite scents it actually  took the place of our money code I used  to own our money coat back in the day  but I do not anymore due to the fact  that this is act exactly a clone from  Armani code by um Armani and it's I  think it's a steal guys I paid for a  50ml I paid $22 on fragrance Netcom and  again I'm not sponsored by that website  or nothing I just like to tell you where  I get my presences from due to the fact  that I think it's a good website and I  haven't had any problems with them and  it's just absolutely good deals up in  that website  I paid again 22 dollars for this and I  know they have a 100 ml for about I  think it's $29.99 but it's still good it  beats getting our money code for around  90 to 100 dollars so let me get into  this fragrance the notes you have  mandarin lemon cardamom and pink pepper  on the initial spray now the dry down  the base the heart of this fragrance you  have iris vetiver cedar wood amber  sandalwood vanilla tonka bean and Maas  now  the beginning of the spray I get a lot  of caramel and pink pepper  especially cardamom which I think it's  pretty good I'm not a big fan of the  opening of this fragrance and I was in a  big fan of the opening of Armani Code  but the dry down I absolutely love I  think it's amazing and with the cardamom  and the pink pepper you also get lemon  you get a little citrus vibe in the  beginning but as soon as the dry down  hits within an hour two hours you get a  lot of iris you get a lot of fearwood  and musk now I'm not too much of a fan  of musky fragrances but this I believe  the tonka bean and the iris work really  really good with each other and the muss  just comes in smoothly and it just takes  charge and I think it's sexy I think  it's good I'm a huge fan of this  fragrance now um the iris does not play  a lipstick vibe on this fragrance and I  know you can either get a powdery vibe  of IRS or you get a lipstick vibe of  iris I think it plays um you get at the  end on the dry now you could get you get  a powdery vibe off of the iris note  which I absolutely no guys I can't get  enough of this fragrance now I would  show you the box but I completely  misplaced the box I do own a lot of  fragrances so I misplace a lot of the  original boxes so I couldn't find it so  I just decided to go ahead and um so go  ahead and do a review on this guys now  I'm going to go ahead and get into what  this fragrance adjustment what it does  for me and um now I've been wearing it  like I said for about a month and I  usually use it more for work and if I'm  going to go out on a date with my wife  now um does she love it I don't know  we'll get to that pretty soon she'll go  ahead and let us know herself but um  again if you're looking for a fragrance  that is actually um like our money coat  I would say go for it rings and so now  everybody knows our money code has a  huge performance issue  and you won't get that with this one  this one actually has better performance  in Armani coat to me on my skin I  believe it lasted a little longer than  our money code as well now we'll get  into that right now I'm going to go  ahead and write this fragrance and I'm  going to start off with the versatility  I'm going to give this a 8 out of 10  I could wear it all season long except  for the high summer heat I will not wear  this friggin for the high summer heat  but now on a date night with your wife  at the beach or wherever you're going I  say it is good for summer nights where  it's not too hot the wind is starting to  come pick up it's starting to get fresh  I would say yeah then go for it but  other than that I would not work in the  high summary I think it's maybe perfect  for the winter and just for the fall I  absolutely love this fragrance on a date  night in the winter I think it works  really really good and that's why I give  an 8 as for the projection I give the  fragrance a 7\/10 the reason why is it  does not project maybe the first hour it  will project pretty good but after that  guys it becomes a close encounter of  fragrance or somebody has to be in your  bubble in order to get a whiff of the  smell but as soon as they are in your  bubble and they get a whiff of the  smells are absolutely going to love that  I haven't had one bad complement of this  fragrance and I had a lot of people  telling me that this fragrance smells  again like Armani code and I believe  doom I own our money code so I actually  don't because I think this is a good  replacement for that as for um the  Armani Profumo now that's a whole  different story but we are talking about  the original so um I do give it a 7 out  of 10 due to the fact that it doesn't  project all that um in a distance but  still with the fragrance now again back  to the performance does it perform it  does within the first two seconds our  this performs really really good guys  actually get a lot of compliments with  this in the first two second hour but  again um as time passes and we get  begins to the State Fair to the skin and  you have to be actually in the bubble in  order to smell it now it does last  between six to seven hours on my skin  then I got to re-add I do carry trouble  atomizer every time I wear this  fragrance if I'm going to be out in  about for some quiet time I will take a  travel atomizer but um I do prefer this  fragrance more than our money code it  does it does smell exactly like our  money code and I just can't get enough  of the guys has better performance I  think it smells really really I mean  it's identical to our money code so and  I'm a huge fan of that it's just code  has big performance issues and I wish it  could last longer in my skin I get four  to five hours max of our money code but  this one I get about two hours excellent  asset especially for the price guys I  paid twenty two dollars for this and I  get tons and tons of compliments so um I  don't want to waste too much of your  time  so we're gonna bring in my wife and um  yeah we're going to bring her in so she  could go ahead and let you know about  this fragrance and if she likes it if  she loves it we're gonna get a woman's  opinion I got it guys this is my wife  Deborah and um alright this was her  first time being on my channel guys so  um yeah so we're gonna get her opinion  on this fragrance and just that I II  know guys you may not there  I wear fragrance just because I love the  art of fragrances but a lot of us were  fragrances to boost our confidence and  to UM attract the other six so we're  gonna get her opinion and I want you you  guys out there if you have this  fragrance go ahead and let me know what  you think down low and if you're about  to get it after you get it you smell it  let me know come back to this video let  me know alright oh um  enough of that we're going to go ahead  and I've actually had this drip right  here I had it I sprayed it about two  hours ago it's been sitting for a while  so she's going to get the opening and  she's gonna get to drive it down now um  let's go ahead and get the dry down real  quick and the sprayer is pretty good  guys actually absolutely love the  sprayer I think it gets full power off  the sprayer  oh all right I'm not a big fan of  spraying it on the script I like to  spray it on my skin due to the fact that  I usually have fragrances that I sprayed  on a script when I'm at the mall looking  at fragrances and when I get home and I  purchased it I don't really like it on  my skin so I like to test fragrances on  my skin but I'm wearing another  fragrance right now so I'm not about to  mix two different different type of  fragrances on my skin so I am going with  the script so um all right here we go  let me know what you think about um big  men since though I like it  all right guys um she's kind of shy  right now so this is like I said it's  our first time being on my youtube  channel she likes it I absolutely know  that guys I love the opening I love the  dry down we're gonna get to the dry down  in a minute in a minute but um please  note our money code if you had to say is  this 100% home to our money code yeah  alright guys and I'm telling you now  just telling you which one here I'm  telling you this smells exactly like our  money code I used to own it I do not  anymore and it's because of this one I  rather pay $25 to $30 for a bottle that  smells really really good for something  that smell similar or exactly like it  for a hundred bucks  alright now we got the dry down it still  smells it smells exactly like the  opening and it's been sitting for two  hours guys now we're gonna have her  smell to dry down  just let it mean you're around here what  do you think of the dry down look I am  now this is this actually has been  sitting two hours longer than this  probably like two minutes but that  sounds things down there you see she  absolutely the do you like it better  than the opening alright guys from um  you've heard now before I have her write  this fragrance I'm gonna go ahead and  rate rate in myself absolutely love it  in general I think it's a beautiful  fragrance it's good for a date night  um I can't get enough of his fragrances  actually a good fragrance now if I have  to rate it from one to ten I would go  with a solid eight point five guys I  think it's sexy I think it could replace  Armani code but the original again not  to perform oh so I give it a good eight  point five guys now we're going to get  her opinion what she thinks about this  fragrance and again she's a woman so of  course we all wore fragrances to please  the other six and or sometimes we just  love the other fragrances guys so um  again Vigna and tinsel if you had to  rate it from one to ten one saying this  record sucks  ten it being sexy what would a weighted  and eight you sure  alright guys do you like the opening as  much as you like the dry down or you  like to dry down  way better than the opening I could  write out there but the open is not  addictive  that's how I see it guys I'm not a big  fan of the opening I mean I like it but  I don't love it as much of the dry down  I get a lot of lemon and a lot of um  cardamon in the beginning but I am an  absolutely I'm a big fan of iris notes  and um seer wood and you get that in the  heart of this fragrance guys and I  absolutely love this fragrance she gives  us an 8 I give an 8.5 um and I don't  know what else to say if you haven't  smelled this fragrance I suggest you go  pick it up if you smelt it let me know  below guys what you think about it and  um that's it for today if you're new  again to this channel subscribe down low  I have another video coming for you  pretty soon and that does it guys again  this is my wife and she is between in  this video so that you know what this  her opinion about this fragrance guys so  again subscribe I will see you soon and  enjoy the rest of your day  ","12":"    by youtube friends welcome to me    channel I bring you a fragrance of    home well my first    Review of the house of Ermenegildo Zegna    which are fragrances that many know    quite well and others don't know many    fragrances from this house and I come to talk    of guamo that are fragrances    just like valentino smoke they create    a rather peculiar feeling    but this egg fragrance at    principle is a fragrance    that doesn't give that feeling    of being a striking fragrance or that    we were satisfied with this fragrance    but when drying    arriving at the time already has a scent    different more equitable that calls more    attention for people who have    used    the first feeling a fragrance    quite aromatic    and it has citrus touches I perceive it very    slightly but I feel that feeling more    of a more aromatic fragrance with a    little wood    and something green and let's look a little more than    information of chosen in a bomb    ideal for use in days and spring not    I think it's a versatile fragrance for    wear at night    fragrance of the olfactory family    woody aromatic for men    will be your in the year 2013 and the fragrance    contain bergamot citrus notes of    calabria vetiver leaves    sorry vetiver and thirst violet leaves    longevity is a fragrance between 3 to 6    hours and your wake will be moderate is    a fragrance    what super forms at the beginning is very    different from the fragrances that we are    accustomed to smell but if you leave a    aromatic sensation that is quite    at least for my nose quite    flashy    and many many people feel that no    it gives them that feeling that they only buy it    because the first impression is good    but    and then it\u2019s not enough to satisfy    they leave it for daily use and they already leave it    as a fragrance to apply on    emergency days in the sense that no    we were going no fragrance and point it appears    meregildo is in water or in the car and we    we apply those fragrances to smell like    something not to smell nothing    to many questions to other people if    it lasts a lot and projects them    best    Y    it's a fragrance    not versatile I don't consider it to be    versatile and many people remind you    that feeling a lot of fragrance    violet like    a simple fragrance a fragrance    clean    what brings those citrus touches    like pretty soft woods and from the    Start if you feel a citrus sensation    pretty good but it feels more    aromatic as it comes with    those violet leaves and it's not a citrus    that stays like a fragrance of    bergamot that at the beginning is a citrus    pure is not feeling this fragrance    how is citrus with not compared yes    no    accompanied together with another note quite    incandescent    but emeregildo dinner has some    fragrances    different better than uom or yes    they leave a better feeling a projection    best and superior quality friends    because the query they have emeregildo    Senna as you write one down with everything    I will gladly answer you, thank you    see you later   ","13":"   hey guys very good morning from Taco  Cabana - joy here with you I'll be doing  a list I pretty sure  lists are something it is noticed a  trend you know people the views on the  list like any list that is summer leaves  winter latest fall list they are  actually more popular in my channel I  mean just my observation so I just  thought let's give people what they like  you know that sort of a thing I wanted  it to a review today as I told you is  any Izumo I'll I'll probably do it  tomorrow okay so here we go the concept  today is not a top 10 list they're gonna  be twelve fragrances here and I wanted  to put up a list for people who  requested me sometimes in my inbox  brother could you do something for like  on the affordable side you know  something that is designer yet cheaper  site not supreme eg pop I'm gonna say  one or two maybe in this list could be  very cheap I'll mention the price I'll  mention brief description the seasons  they are from different seasons  different type different price range as  well as different age level and  performance also varies but there's  something in here for everyone right so  if you're interested watch out are  between this series in time I'll do  quite a few more lineup like this I have  quite a lot of cheapest to show you but  good is right so these are not  necessarily particularly any order  they're all good okay so it's not a  ranking twelve to one but you can see it  as you want alright so number twelve  let me start with this fragrance I  reviewed all of them so far yes and let  me go with the fragrance that I thought  not long ago this from house of Armagh  five don't know if this is discontinued  but it's not super pricey and this  fragrance actually to my nose it's a  sort of like a somewhat close to haven't  responds I'm not a scientist clone but  it's it seven does ish fragrance I has  good performance on it it smells really  nice on try down opening is a little bit  harsh and this pregnancy really serves  well I mean for the purpose for the  price it's really good  okay so I started with our mouth I TiVo  for men so bear in mind that this  fragrance has a ladies version and it  has quite a few versions dark version I  think intense version all whatnot but if  you find I Devo by our mouth  check out the fragrance don't blind by  all right and see this is pretty much  like your $20 budget it smells really  really good for a very long time  it's ideal for office work casual day  Jimo so I think it will do good nice  bottle as I was telling you heavy glass  very good quality from our mouth and I'm  hope the rumors I hear about arm off are  not true I hope they're not closing down  right so I'm line number 12 arm of ID  book check this out there's a great  fragrance all year round and for a  cheapy it's pretty damn good ok now  moving on to number 11 there is a  fragrance now this is called power pack  fragrance this is a house it's known for  its performers they more or less all of  them really last some of them too much  for some people but this is highly  underrated fragrance I don't believe any  people who need or reviewed it there's a  house of House of Jack bobert one-man  show line this is Ruby edition so this  fragrance you know I sort of like reach  for this only waiters this has beautiful  fruity up top apples and a little bit  alq like a boozy notes and stuff but it  goes typical leather and then it has the  typical one-man-show  back boom but it's very good performer  it's it's hardly $15 or so pretty much  below $20 so people who are asking for a  performer I would recommend this check  out my review on this fragrance I think  I did review on this and I talked about  in a couple of videos one-man show Ruby  Edition number 12 a very good performer  okay now number 10 number 10 add the red  fragrance this fragrance I talked about  it like like pink one year back I  haven't put it anywhere in my list or  anything but I just was scooping you  know how to fragrances from my  collection and I saw this this is  yuk-man  red there's also a blue version which I  will show sometime in future but this  it's really I mean inexpensive this is  below $10 if I'm not mistaken I don't  know how much it's going for in the  market  that excellent looking bottle it has a  nice sort of sail team has a nice  attached cap so you don't lose your cap  and this melts a lot like Daniel desire  red but much nicer time desire it will  give me headache and it's too strong too  metallic this has eerie vibe to it it's  like summers if you wear this as a  student you're gonna get compliments it  smells very uh like bright out there  daytime scent and it's very fresh almost  think of going on the sea it's like sea  breeze but sweet right yeah mad red  number 10 now number nine there's a  fragrance and got a lot of hype sold a  lot of bottles around and it could hide  because of one factor that this is a  clone of a fragrance which is very  popular  that is la nuit alone and you guys know  I'm talking about Zara why check this  fragrance out now I think it can be had  cheaper than like ten pounds that's like  what a deal is like $15 or so for a  hundred middle so this frame is the only  difference between this and my line with  alone which is my last decent batch of  vintage formulation I don't think this  has the cardamom sexiness that has you  know that Lani tell'em has six see sort  of a cardamom this one rather replaces  lot of citrus it's much more fresher it  has a little bit powdery touch of  powdery feel and it's I would say a  little sweeter than la nuit de lo but  this is a lovely setting lasts quite a  bit on my clothing right for the price  you cannot go wrong zero Y is my next  pick nine okay number eight from house  off I'm off again our mob does really  well for the price bracket they offer  you these fragrances you cannot deny  them so this another clone but this has  good performance this has better  performance than 0y and it's a very  popular fragrance they cloned this is  our mouse Ventana this is a clone of  your siwash okay doesn't have quite a  bit more projection longevity like your  offers you but for the price $22 and  whatnot it's being offered for shouldn't  pass on this this smells very very  perhaps one of those clones that smells  very close to the originals  and it smells a lot like your subbatch -  that situation that peppery kick is  missing but it smells damn fresh you  know it kinda clothing it to last like  four or five hours solid I think it's a  great fragrance our mom's Ventana now  when we go to number seven and I have a  fragrance it's from Dow mmm like back in  the time I broke the bottle you know the  story this is a house of Jaguar car  company this fragrance can be had for I  think now $20 or less and this smells  pretty much the same like a family of  ego boss bottled or wires alone which  are very popular but still on the higher  side of pricing so if you're looking for  a budget option but that smells really  good as well as it has good performance  I will say like seven out of ten which  is not bad at all and it gets  compliments yeah go classic cold  definitely looking to do this more out  say oh yeah I would say this is more  pressure than compared to the West a low  more he gobos bottle it still has the  apple pie sort of feel but a lot more  citrus going on and it's much more  fresher it's great for a fall and summer  steaks okay  great for office work and gets decent  performance as well for the price very  good Jaguar classic gold alright  so ten nine eight seven six then we'll  go with Nam top five so the number six  this fragrance is built for women I saw  it I sniffed it and it definitely has  that clone feel again it cloned one of  the very popular Creed fragrances that  is silver mountain water and this from  the house of Al haramein this one didn't  get so much talk in the community that's  why I'm showing it here so people give  it a little bit more love  it smells much better than in my opinion  the opening is better than even Russ's  Entebbe okay so you guys know this is la  venture launch and this is for women  okay  in the marketer for women but it can be  worn by both genders this smells right  from the first spray you smell this it  smells like a wiener  it has a bubble let me fill up topical  sweet  and it does like wow you the opening  will really wow you okay and it does  smell very very wearable and much  sweeter version than silver mountain  water - the ink note - the you know that  the metallic tones much more wearable  and compliment getter instantly okay so  lemon chip launched by alarming number  six number five I'm gonna talk about  this fragrance not many people talked  about this this is a highly underrated  juice if you love language alone if you  do like Mon belong individual since like  that and you want something more I'm not  saying there's a clone of any of those  this is a scent on its own it has a  darkness it has a sweetness  it has mysterious feel to it it has  great performance and House of ck Calvin  Klein  you guys need to look at this dark  obsession not new release but this is in  my opinion highly rated I have run  reviews on this and if you love it  there's a caramel note in this it's it's  amazing use it's just beautiful romantic  and perfect evening time scent okay dark  obsession for men by Calvin Klein so now  moving on to number four and bring back  this fragrance from house of yo just  trying to keep it at good mix so this  fragrance house it's very cheap you know  like all these fragrance basically are  $30 or below but this pregnancy can have  it for I believe 26 $25 or more or less  this is Yoko look at a beautiful bottle  with the green juice in it must have  seen it everywhere so if you're looking  for a cheapy like it's not extremely  super ly cheap like ten dollars or so no  but for the hundred mil you paying less  than thirty dollars that's a cheap E and  this smells very unique from the house  of Europe of course their fragrance  always sweet but this one I think it has  a nice tea note in it I don't know if  someone detected it or not I detect that  right in the opening it makes it very  super safe and great for Jane anything  fresh out of the shower  daytime casual like a signature scent  worthy this I would highly you know I  would try it you know it's they said  you've jump and this very similar but  your jump or  a little better but this thing it has a  freshness that is bit more modern than  your jump I would definitely look into  this okay this is my suggestion to you  as number four  yoku very beautiful juice all right take  a look at this number three I'm gonna go  with the most the cheapest in this  lineup from house of your one my recent  purchases call your one mask tropical  mask for men check out my review on this  what I said about this fragrance  I don't know how available this is in  like your country or your location but  in my country I just saw one bottle I  didn't so that's it  I didn't see it anywhere else in  Bangladesh you

fragrance you  know I have sprayed it here in paper I  think this is the most luxurious  fragrance at least one of them in this  price bracket it's unbelievable how  cheap you can get this for I think and  get it for $30 maybe 35 I'm still  counting the cheapy because this house  everything else is expensive this is Van  Cleef and our post pearl real manly man  scent if you're looking for performance  at night time you want some dark leather  you want some potency you want some  maybe tobacco in there I'm not sure but  this fragrance it's literally high-class  juice if if you put up like if I put up  top leather fragrances at night time  this is great for winter basically  winter and fall but I would pick this up  in winter like a summer cooler nights  alright this is really up class and I'm  telling you you need to put your nose on  this one this is a hidden gem when given  are postponed  that leads me to number one and number  one I'm gonna show you a fragrance  I'm just gonna say it's a perfect 10 out  of 10 beautiful composition price-wise  is cheap cut off that price point right  and this projects a project it's magical  three four people ask me like dude what  are you wearing  it's coming from your neck I want get a  decant of this stuff right you can have  it from us be baking Bangladesh my good  brother brother a friend I bring this  fragrance  thanks to you from pi for introducing me  to this it was a blind buy but I love  Tom for Tuscan leather and this is not  awful Tuscan leather but as good as that  this is from house of Nabil and this  call Arab tradition this is a clone of  Tuscan leather I also have like one but  that is like around your $80 but yet  this you can have it or much cheaper my  god I don't know exactly thirty or forty  dollars whatever you pay I still  consider the cheapy and this fragrance  literally like things $30 or so am I  forgot exactly how much it is every time  you sniff it the opening will blow you  away it has that time note it has a  sweet raspberry touch to it and more  time goes by you start sniffing that  suede just like Tuscan leather and in my  opinion Tuscan olive doesn't last that  much for the price I am still like you  know half mine I should I get it or not  but Tuscan leather is my dream so this  is also living the dream Arab tradition  by Nabil my number one suggestion for  this a lot

 days and then I want to give you my opinion and    well, I recommend you if you don't    have you had the opportunity to receive it    Well, I think it has given me a great    surprise this this perfume I bought it    and I have it I started using it without without    wait any    no expectation without even    I knew what I wanted and for the truth    I took a very    big surprise let's see a little more than    close but before seeing the perfume    I want to congratulate    my subscriber jose francisco guti\u00e9rrez    for following us on our channel for    comment on the videos and well greetings    Jose and well then let's see a little more    up close this a smoke of ermenegildo    zegna so accompany    the friends are already here in front of    this smoke from ermenegildo zegna in    our presentation chair of these    swallow is not well Italian brand    Armenians elda uom or as I have already    commented as it refers to man in    Italian so every time you see how    it is precisely that not well well me    surprised a lot is a discovery    that I did since there never was    tried I didn't even know him    and your friend friend that we are seeing    these videos because we are really    learning together    and that's something chingo to learn together and    share opinions and I ran into this    real egg surprised me a lot    it's a very good perfume let's open it    a little bit let's look at your box    first we have him    how it can feel very touch    slightly and the letters of ermenegildo    zegna also here in front we have    also up sorry can you feel the    finger touch and something you have to    they have to check friends is the    box    passing the fingernail they feel    stripes very slightly since the bottle    It is also scratched, I don't know if you can    reach to see there and it's not smooth but    what it feels like to pass    lined here we have your stamp and by    here we don't have anything else    and here we have the reverse that comes in    Many languages    manila not so let's open it for    to verify this is excellent    fragrance    to carla    we have a protector the jobs are    put here    and this and here we have friends on    zegna smoke    let's see here    It also feels to touch it and how you    I comment the container is scratched the same    feel in the box    that same line is a container    Well, if I don't know what you think of yourself    friends what do you think but I know    a little rough is not ugly but    also this one is also not of the    best I've seen but    but if you say a lady and here we have    let's go to hermenegildo zegna    let's open it    same hard plastic cover same as    may    it feels    the stripes and well then because I    surprised that perfume so much not what    at least as I told you it moved    I had not smelled any of Mexico sep no    we are talking about this coming out in the year    2013    it's something citrus your olfactory family is    woody aromatic but contain other    citrus bergamot females too    we have violet leaves out there the    vetiver and cedar the truth is I what    I perceive as woody with citrus bone    dawned fresh without becoming    so woody so much the lady do by    To say it to me is a modern wood    I put it on and it really gave me a very    good duration i'm telling you that I    give this perfume    about 45 hours projecting    a trail of moderate a little more    heavy    I think it gives me between 5 and 6 hours    flush with skin I still have much more    time I think it's giving me    around 10 between 10 11 hours in a    fragrance as I commented fresh but    semi-formal wood can be used in    hot times I think it remains    excellently in these times of    summer here in mexico where is it makes    very hot I think it gives a very good    projection    a very good aroma too and what    life also as I told you I was    giving between about 11 hours    so the truth is they are very good perfume    and an excellent aroma    surprised a lot I fixed this very well    smoke and well    Price here in Mexico we can    find between 1,200 and 1,800 pesos    It's like the range where you can    find him    it's worth it or not I don't know I think so    since for the price maybe we can    find perfumes also from another    quality like the one that would be read as    it would be one million and many others out there    the 212 for the price or so but    I think    that this is an excellent aroma if    you get at the price that you more or less    I say how I tell you is between 1,200    and 1000 7,800 already for very expensive but for    there if you get it, the truth is a    excellent aroma and as always you    commented so let's experiment with    other perfumes and the truth that is something    very funny or because many during    many years in that I include myself I    we marry fragrances and use it    a lifetime when there are thousands and thousands of    fragrances that we can try and we can    experiment with them and the truth this    It is an excellent perfume that I    liked it a lot and of course you    the data passed and could friends if you    served this video    then subscribe and leave us your    comments    if you have used it or if you have not    used give it a try for the    TV and well on my part is everything    and see you in the next videos until    soon   ","15":"   hello everybody Matt here and welcome to  my fragrance obsession in this episode  I'm gonna be unwrapping a fragrance  which I actually purchased today from my  local shopping center and I'm also going  to be doing an impression of this  fragrance now I have actually smelled  this fragrance before but I will be  going over how I think it smells and  what I think of it so please stay tuned  everybody and we will talk about this  amazing fragrance this is a fragrance by  Amana gildo Zegna and this is called  woman now I went out today because today  is my birthday at the 9th of March 2016  and I did not want to come home without  buying a fragrance or something so I  went into this department store so I  picked up this fragrance and I paid an  amazing 23 pounds for this fragrance  this is a 50 ml bottle but it was  originally 47 pounds so there's a it's  pretty much half price so very very  decent price in my opinion so we're  gonna turn to this fragrance and I'm  going to tell you guys what I think of  it so here we go somebody's gonna taste  it that dog never stops barking okay  guys so I've just unwrapped this box and  let me give you a little bit of a  presentation of what it looks like up  close  now I do not know what this camera is  gonna be like once this video is  uploaded but right now I can actually  just see that this box has really kind  of these really small rigid lines going  where that way across it so it's really  nice and when you put your hand down you  can really even really feel it's really  really nice we get one more there in the  middle in embossed black writing we also  get a min ago Lu Zegna across the top  there and black writing embossed out of  toilet natural spray 1.7 ounce 50 mil  the fragrance itself is made in  Switzerland so really cool so amana girl  knows Enya performs distribution new  york new york yeah so there's nothing  really going on on the size pop them on  the sides we don't get this shiny card  is really nice like really nice feel and  we also get the name of the house there  on the top so yeah let's tear into this  box I'm actually really excited to see  what this boat looks like so obviously  I've seen the ball I know what it looks  like and stuff but I just want to see  what it looks like now this is the bowl  beautiful this is a really really  beautiful bowl really nice design yeah  really really like this  I'm gonna go to Zegna on the top there  let me get a warm over there on the  bottom I really like that uh actually  looks like it's got a really really good  atomizer as well obviously I kind of  smell it yeah because it hasn't been  sprayed but let's smell it yeah should  be fine very good spray guys it may  squirt a little bit but it's it actually  does spray very well so ok so straight  away while I get straight off the top is  I get this kind of very boozy kind of  very spicy citrus kind of metallic  bergamot sort of smell I'm also getting  a bit of vetiver as well kind of like a  grassy sort of smell really nice even  though it's got that spicy kind of  metallic smell I'm also getting this  kind of bright smell from it as well  really really nice really really nice  now in 2007 the company of vinegar  lasagna actually released a fragrance  called Zegna in tencel which is I don't  know if it's a flanker of an original  Zegna fragrance or something but that  one came out 2007 and apparently it's a  really nice fragrance now I actually do  really like this fragrance I think that  it does have a lot to offer before  actually unboxing this fragrance and  actually just wanting to smell it  properly I did look on base notes and I  did get a lot of kind of there was a lot  of kind of mutual reviews on this  fragrance on there a lot of people said  that it was synthetic I do get a  synthetic vibe if I'm honest with you it  does doesn't really smell natural I  guess  but I think it's it's just a very clean  scent and I do think that it's very  casual and you I don't really think  you'll get compliments with it really  you might actually get compliments but  it does smell really really good and I'm  really really happy with this fragrances  this got a nice vibe to it very clean  peppery  very sharp opening but after a while I  can really tell that it dies down to  something really beautiful and I'm  getting that kind of citrus sort of  bergamot black pepper sort of vibe but  um it's definitely a leathery scent it's  very suede musk sort of smell but it's  not like a dark musk fragrance this is I  would say more kind of like a white musk  sort of sin yeah that's probably what I  would say it's it's very nice I would  highly recommend you check this figures  out because it is discounted quite a lot  of the men so yeah guys this has been my  review for wool moe by Amana Gilda  zinnia I believe I'm pronouncing the  name right but this fragrance came out  in 2013 so it's been out for three years  now and I really really like this  fragrance and I'm really happy with it  so so yeah guys uh today is my birthday  and I've had a really good day I'm  really happy that I bought this  fragrance so please stay tuned guys and  I will definitely keep you updated so  thank you very much for watching this  episode of my fragrance obsession it's  been full warm oh by Minna gildo zinnia  thank you so much for watching guys take  care yourself and keep smelling good  thank you bye-bye  ","16":"   what's up my fried heads your boy j-rock  hitting you were another fragrance  review like we always do  today we're gonna be reviewing something  from the house of Cigna this signal homo  so you know we do it I want you with a  three-piece presentation performance and  price then we're gonna get into the sin  itself so y'all ready for that all right  let's start with the presentation this  arm this bar oh it's kind of tall they'd  almost do that case up 200 mil on a  bottle but it's actually out 100  milliliters the 3.4 ounce but almost  looks like a two hundred ounce cuz it's  so big but it's really a thin and you  look at it right there it's real thin  had it been chunky like wider like that  and then in be shorter you know so it  wouldn't look as huge as it does says  one more down here we have the other end  for you will need on the bottom the top  has the name right there Cigna Rome also  and so the top sucks it's a real light  plastic very flimsy on cheaply made very  cheaply made and it has these like rigid  so it's not the greatest thing but hey  it does what if the post was just  supposed to cover the atomizer and stop  top the atomizer from spraying so I saw  you when you really need it for so when  you fill the bottle it also has those  rigid like the roughest chips and it  almost fooled me into thinking when I  saw the bar the cap when I got it on the  capita was gonna be I almost thought it  was plastic for a minute then I got  alright it's glass at least but yeah  needless to say it's kind of simplistic  I'm not the biggest fan of this bottle  to be honest  I'll give this presentation like a 5 on  a scale of 1 to 10  let's get into performance as long as as  far as our longevity I get about a good  6 hours with this  which is fine um six hours is okay for  what it is you also get the projection  is not too loud it's it's a softer scent  it's not very overly aggressive or  anything like that well for the type of  synthesis it actually works in your  favor it's actually better did this in  Assam not too loud because the same DNA  itself is kind of a little more  sophisticated so it would make sense  that the projections a little softer in  my opinion and yeah so for what this is  the performance  I'll give it a 7.5 I thought it was  pretty good performance now the price on  this I think it reaches for like 70 but  you can find it online for around 25 he  babe fragrance neh somewhere on that  ballpark it's about what it's going for  I forgot what I paid for it but that's  wrong because I bought it I bought it  used up somebody on our Facebook group  but it was for around 25 bucks new this  one was basically new it just doesn't  have the parts but I'm in the Burroughs  basically all the way full so um for  that price 25 bucks I think that's it's  like a nine I think that's a chili I'll  give it a ten it's a great price I have  no complaints totally worth 25 bucks in  my book when you're talking about $70  retail price then it gives you cos to  pause I do you really want to spend that  much which I wouldn't recommend just  because you can find a cheaper online so  I do that okay so yeah ten hundred ten  for price right let's give this a spray  so we could get into the same but after  opening you get those citrus notes I got  citrus notes oh it does feel fresh and  citrusy and you get the bergamot and you  get the bergamot and that's the opening  it's a nice fresh opening there's  nothing special but it's enjoyable lasts  about 10-15 minutes once  you did it right I'm a little bit you  start getting a pilot leaves no so you  get that violet going and the bergamot  that's kind of the main prayer and  opening it kind of takes a backseat and  then the pilot becomes the main player  you kind of the violet becomes Jordan  and the bergamot becomes kind of like  look longer or somebody you know just a  supporting cast member this pilot isn't  like you're Fahrenheit where it's up  strong aggressive pilot note and it has  that petrol vibe to it this this a pilot  Lee is some it's very it's like watery  almost I almost want to say like a pilot  like a quadric if that makes sense  that's kind of the feel I get from me  it's like watery a very elegant very  sophisticated super versatile I think  where this was shine is definitely an  office environment if you got your  office or if you got a cubicle you're in  a suit and tie or and it's a body not  this would be great for that type of our  situations but it can also work if  you're in a warehouse  tossing boxes around or you're working  on customer service at Walmart it works  for any of those situations even if your  kid in junior high or your student in  college there were straw those groups  this is at a price anyone can afford and  it's a saint that anyone can enjoy no  one will be offended it can be classy  and it can be casual so it gets mad  points for that as well and so this is a  good one for real though so if I have to  give this one a grade I was gonna give  it an eight but you know what this one  isn't just good it's really good so I'm  gonna give it a 8.25 it's not quite on  the great tier but it's on the really  good tear though  yeah this is a this is a great one to  have in your arsenal this is one that  I'll you could take  to work with you every day now  yeah might be that our 8.25 someone give  the overall score considering price and  everything I'm gonna give it a 8.75  considering price performance and and  everything that goes with it this is uh  this is one that's worth having and I  don't have much more to say about it so  I guess I'll just let you guys know in  the description down below check me out  on my other social medias I have the  links down there and you know if you  liked what you saw hit that subscribe

video that way you never miss a beat  and that's all I got for you guys today  now together next time  ","17":"   what is up everybody out there on  YouTube thanks for joining me here in my  channel Steven spiritual guy said today  once again we're not looking at odhh not  surprised surprised looking at a slight  throwback this guy out of managed heed  those in yeah Wawa which means man  obviously Natalya got this little  sampler here you can pick up a bottle of  this guy's for believing at about 50  mils online typically for around 17  bucks $17 to us you can get the hundred  medals for around between 25 and 30  dollars so really really really budget  frag that sadly otherwise wasn't nearly  that cheap went and dropped initially in  department stores and designer retail  outlets I think it probably retail for  around the larger bottle for between 80  and 100 and the smaller I'm guessing  around 50 to 65 just roughly speaking is  this good yes it's very good this is  very very very good indeed but let me  preface that or firstly say that as a  lover of fine fragrances perfumes  colognes soy de toilettes as my nose is  becoming more and more refined not to  sound snobbish but I'm getting more and  more exposed as time goes by it's really  really fine and some very high-end  fragrances the nuances and fragrances  like this that are indeed very cheap and  budget frags don't get me wrong it's an  excellent fragrance especially for what  it is but you can kind of detect that  this isn't real high-dollar juice and  the elements in here are not extremely  costly they're just not and you're not  going to get the essence of a five  hundred dollar bottle of juice here  you're not going to get that I don't  care if you've got the hundred mils I'm  just using this obviously to represent  the  the Cologne which is emedia the toilet  consequence in song you know so it's  it's not ever going to be toe to toe  it's not it's never going to stand toe  to toe with a $2,000 perfume but nor for  the matter mmm and yeah a $250 bottle of  juice might not go toe to toe with a  $2,000 bottle or it might some of that  maybe maybe it's a little arbitrary and  just you know notice in this nose in the  air of snobbery  however as offensive as this may sound a  lot of it is real and it's not meant to  be offensive it's just meant to be  factual and the difference guys is that  if you're if you're riding in a Ferrari  are you riding in a bent link that has  Connolly leather from England and  elements from France and Italia and  Deutschland or whatever you're often  going to be able to compare that to like  a typical American leather or typical  Chinese leather or typical Japanese  leather are just typical leather in  general and you will see a huge  difference the better leather is more  supple and doesn't crack nearly as fast  as cheap leather it wears far better  over time than cheap leather and can  sometimes even smell better for a longer  amount of time and that's just facts  guys so don't let that rub you the wrong  way it is what it is what it is the  bottom line this is this worth $30 400  mils yes it is easily it's probably  worth easily 60 to 70 to 80 bucks 400  mils this is really really a fine  fragrance and I was absolutely  complimented today was my scent of the  day smells so fresh and clean perfect  for summer and perfect for spring now  I'm not one of these guys that  absolutely adheres to the code of summer  and the code of spring and you must only  wear light citrus fresh cheese in the  spring and summer that's not me  I wear what I want to wear whenever I  want to wear  in the story so if I want to wear a  heavier cloying spicy heavy musky scent  in the summer I will do that but I'm  learning not to spray us heavily  certainly in front of me if I'm going to  going to work I want to spray maybe just  three three lights phrase for absolutely  outer limit and let it die down and then  go into work but that's just me but for  those of you that adhere to that code of  summer coat is Franco to fall or what  have you this is perfect perfect frag  now strong points negative points let's  get into it let's get into the notes  first I do not know who the nose on this  was but I will say it says that the the  face with their campaign was Ryan burns  and the photographer for that campaign  was Matthew Brooks for whatever that  does for you  okay the notes you're getting into so  this is supposed to represent a typical  Calabria Italia sort of coordinated  journey or Jordan or Giorgio Nardone  anyways  citrusy notes company by cords of viola  team captive which is violently  pheasants essence what do you notice if  cedar vetiver some other stuff in there  it probably has a little neroli and  maybe something like lemon possibly  it definitely has Calabria and bergamot  or Bergamo of course the vetiver cedar  and the violet leaf essence I believe  there's something else in here guys I'm  not sure exactly what maybe coriander  maybe maybe a little neroli it's hard to  tell what all maybe maybe actually in  this but it's light there's definitely  some woods  there's the vetiver there's the citrusy  citruses from something like I don't  know mandarin orange lime lemon  in the Calabrian burton Bergamo and then  there's the violet leaf essence and i  gives it a light lush happy clean  yeppity-do da you get that citrus  freshness you get the sort of some of  the lushness of that violet leaf essence  again with it and this isn't a real  strong heavy vetiver it's definitely  there you can definitely smell a bit  more sown the dry down and in the heart  and definitely if you get this cedar  Accords in here as well so you get some  woods it's just really nice and elegant  you will absolutely smell like oak a  multi-millionaire if you wear this frag  you will get absolutely you will get  compliments I almost can guarantee  you'll get compliments now those are all  huge positives and by the way it has  really excellent performance I was blown  away by the power of this frag for an  EDT mind-blowing performance now I will  say I sprayed heavy I'm not gonna lie  about that I mean I am I pretty much gas  to myself out but it lasted all the way  all the way through the night through a  really hard shift not a really harsh it  but I mean lots of action on some sweat  you know some some labor and I just kept  on performing I kept on smelling it all  throughout the night so it's it's  somewhat it's somewhat pinching over its  white class for an ADT is performing a  lot more like like a like an EDP like I  was a part foam and or even an X tray  for that matter I mean I was really  blown away by the performance of this  thing so there's all of that all that's  positive right so you're asking yourself  oh what's this negative thing you're  talking about what it what possible net  I'll tell you and and again I hate for  this to sound snobbish but the only  negatives that I can tell you as a  connoisseur of perfumes and colognes and  more modern scent  our higher dollar perfumes and colognes  is that this isn't exactly pushing the  envelope real hard and that's definitely  not nice at all  this is this is like opposite spectrum  of niche so if you're someone that  already has a large collection and you  already have go to spring fragrances  this is probably and let me also add if  some of those go to spring summer fall  fragrances happen to be very high-end  modern designer house are fairly high in  niche houses all the way up to extremely  high in these houses you're not probably  going to be the candidate for this  nothing you might well fall in love with  it I'm not saying that you might love it  but you probably will not be the top  candidate on the list to go out and  spend your money not that you don't have  money because you always see there you  mean buying all those expensive products  this is not probably going to peel real  real high on your olfactory radar  sensibilities it's it's probably not  you're probably going to smell this and  thinks it smells stayed safe typical  designer and sort of an easy frag to  produce for these people for these  companies for you and I might be a  miracle or you know our nightmare or  work hard or whatever you get the drift  but this isn't really at the level of  her maze this isn't not neroli from our  maze you know one of their spring fresh  cheese but it's really really good it's  really legitimately very good for its  level and for what it is smells  fantastic but yes it does smell designer  II smell spent very good but also yes  smells a bit safe and dare I say  traditional Italian it's having  said that it's also very versatile  that's why so one of its weaknesses is  also one of its strings this is  extremely versatile fragrance you could  easily wear this to the office the  library the gymnasium the symphony the  play the movie the date the wedding the  funeral not to be glum or negative but  we sometimes have to go to those things  this is extremely versatile and I think  that's one of its incredible strengths  and appeals this is something you could  reach for honestly you a lot of us out  there should probably make this one of  our go-to frags when we can't think of  what to use on certain occasion are we  just something to get bored with our  rotation reach for this you're good you  may not love love love it but I  guarantee you'll like it and so will  most of your friends and family so  pretty high praise indeed especially for  30 bucks or less for the hundred mils  and twenty dollars or less for the the  50 mils and believe they may or may not  offer 30 mils and you can get these  samples online for about between 50  cents on the dollar honestly if you want  to get your nose on this get you a  sample online for 50 cents $2 that's  gonna do it guys and wrap it up I will  catch you next time  spray often spray well live life

","19":null,"20":"   what's up guys     this is      Jeremy and this   is my top     10 best fall fragrances list   from the designers side     so let's start   off with     probably      the      only ralph lauren   fragrance     i will ever mention number 10   spot     pollo      double black gets good   reactions from     the ladies      check it out   if you     get a chance      or a good deal on it   number     nine is quite similar to      pollo   double black but has a bit     of a more   sexual     Ashley this      is called potion by d   squared     my number      nine      spot   woody     sexual musky manly      unmistakably   manly fragrance     like guys would wear   after the     second world war without   smelling dated     seriously guys this   doesn't     smell data to just smells very   masculine     but still      only      my number      nine   spot     d      squared potion my number      eight   spot     and this is the hardest to wear       fragrance from all of these fragrances       because you have to know how to handle       this fragrance my number eight spot       Versace   the dreamer     oh that smells so      synthetic       and      bird ooh bad fragrance you don't   know how to     smell a fragrance again      I'm   gonna show you okay     you      just spray it       don't spray that close because      you will       just have a big drop of liquid on your       hand that's too concentrated      at best if   you can spray it from     a distance      but you       also hit the target your hand in this   case     BAM      everything hit my hand      and now       I'm      just letting      the fragrance come      to   me and     that's exactly the thing      why many   girls dislike this fragrance when they  smell this     close like      BAM because it   doesn't smell good     but if it lingers in   the     air if you have your nice scent       trail after      you   it's     gorgeous it gets you so many   compliments seriously this could     be   higher     on this list      but from now on all   the     fragrances are really really really       good      and      that's why it has hard hard   competition  and     only maybe on the number      8 spot but   bang for the buck     probably the best out   of all of those except for my number     4       frags      number 4 fragrance it's also great   bang for the buck     this one for such a   dreamer     don't underestimate it      we keep   going with     number 7 Jean Paul Gautier       ultramel and you take on the legendary       jump over      toilet mouth that was highly   highly     circumcised      doesn't have      the   strength that it once had     doesn't have       the magic that it once had this is great   stuff     gets compliments get the job done       great for the club      great for fall      number       7 for Jean Paul Gautier ultraman number   6 is     the friends that      I haven't talked   about     yet      and this one is called      Mont       Blanc individual so this fragrance       smells like your pond like Crete   original     sent out my advice      if you like   this category of     the fragrance because   it's very unique     go for mont blanc and   video well it's very     very floral kind      of   strange sweet     clubbing fragrance and   it's a very     very high complicated   probably the biggest head turner     in this   list because it's just a     blah   what was that     like seriously seriously   strong and has turning effect that this  fragrance accomplished     mont blanc   individual well let's keep going with     my       number 5 spot      for      all of you guys that   love the so far     forgotten armani coat   fragrance     i do like it      but they are      not   happy     with      the performance      that it has I   got the solution     for      you guys this one   is called     Xenia and      tinsel and this       smells pretty much identical      for Armani   coat     but with a better not much but with   a better     performance it's a good friends   in it  very     a      very safe      you cannot go wrong       with      this fragrance you will get   compliments     maybe

great great   great stuff guys such a compliment  getter     such a great performance opens   like Chanel allure     arm has maybe 10% of       land weed alum and it's just nice      it's   manly     and I feel and many guys and girls   told me     this is very upscale and       masculine but also it can be a bit   aggressive     this has an aggressive      touch   I prefer this wearing it     outside walking       around with a nice coat      manliness and a   bottle sexy edge definitely a great  go-to guy for almost     any occasion   in the     forum so let's keep going Wow my   top     three you probably are having some       kind of intention which ones these could   be but you     don't know in which      order I   have placed them     number 3 CH man   Carolina Herrera     great      great fragrance       whoa this is my when I hug you      you give   me     a compliment fragrance      because 90% of   the time whenever     I give a girl left       kiss right kiss hug a girl

high compliment getter      it does not   it does     not nearly have the performance       of this but because it is such a great       compliment getter      I had to   in front     of this and also some of      you   guys     are asking      what's up with Caroline   I had a CH     man      Prive      this one is for the       winter time      so this one great stuff   amazing smell the only

be in my     collection      whoo number   two and number     one      all right guys I       don't know if I can do      that guys ah my   heart     oh I don't      know if I      can do it   shit I'm looking at     it and I see where   it's     standing   my heart hurts I don't know if I     can       show you      number two       Len weed alone Len weight      alone only       make number      two spot let's make a moment   of silence for this land weed alone only      make number      two spot this looks like the   EDP but this is actually     the EDT limited   edition     because I think the 200 ml of       which I have like 20 bottles doesn't   look     good so that's why I      took this one   right here     Landen we the      lung all de       toilette number      two spot fall fragrances   list     and for those      of you who are asking   what's up with this this beats it     terms       of      lady reactions      and in terms of   performance     although this has written       intense on it okay      guys what's the       number one spot some of      you we're   thinking     alright probably has to be what   are those super sexy     great friends that       are suitable for though when      Freya      for   the     fall Jeremy is the guy      that loves   great reactions     sexy reactions probably   is this     one right here      dolce gabbana      the   one but I'm sorry guys     don't think about   another     one did not make the list      week   projection     we don't need that guys for   the     fall we don't need week projection   like dolce gabbana the one that's why      sorry guys just brought it right here to       show it      to you but my number one fall   fragrance     are you ready guys      I know   you're sitting     right

    because this is      everything we want it   from this it exactly exactly smells the  same which many     friends companies do   wrong     when they do an EVP version of the   EDT     of a popular fragrance and they       totally mess up the French smells   different this     smells exactly the same   like     dough to the bottom      of the one but   it lasts at     least one or two      hours   longer     it's not a B such as a projection   and     longevity but still the DNA of      this   friends     is unbeatable      I got so many       through the roof great reactions like   really girls almost     having an orgasm   while staying     like oh my god      perfection   stuff like that this is crazy  don't     forgive honor the one older parfum   my number one fragrance     for the

time with   another one  bye  ","21":"    good    [Music]    Maris people deserve to stay    welcome to my channel again    French minis channel in another video and    today I will talk about several    fragrances that have in the name    including the term or the word uam or    as it says here and what does the    word woman then the translation of the    word uom or from italian to spanish    it would be man or men in English so they are    terms they use in fragrances    to give it a little more street a    little more presence because in the end    we know they are male fragrances    when it comes to a fragrance form    real or for you a selection not    It has nothing to do with each other    they are well known others maybe not    so let's start with this count    number one the first one I bring for you    it is a fragrance of the year 1984 a    dark fragrance a fragrance that such    once is not well known and is of the brand    aramis and it's called toscani but    as there where is the word as is    this box over here and over here is the    bottle this is from a series of    fragrances where is also that of    devin and have the same style of    bottle this is a wow super fragrance    super old school with notes    Lemon dominant aniseed leather and lavender    this is a fragrance that really    you can enter the category of    aromatic fragrances had very    powerful and one that I love and like    quite because it is one of the ones that has    a very very good duration at least in    my skin has a fairly cheap price    it's a classic fragrance that is one what    have seen really should take a    look and you should try to try it    your dad probably used you or    someone with an age of approximately    about 50 years or so then this    is the first look and see how    I'll bring one of the year for you right away    1992 a pretty rich fragrance is    fragrance in my opinion yes it's a bit    best known and comes from the Laura brand    Biagiotti and her name is Laura Biagiotti    rome uom and the bottle resembling a    Roman building or structure    obviously and here it is and there is the    man from rome    and out there says the word how is it    fragrance contains resin notes    of benja and grapefruit galvano and for me    This fragrance is a very similar to the    also well known as paloma picasso    that of the minotaur this wow fragrance    delicious creamy with some freshness in    the bottom so this is a fragrance    that can be an off-road fragrance    that doesn't stop you but it makes me    that has not been given the love that    I should to this fragrance not many people    it has not many people comment like this    that if you can keep an eye on a    look and you can buy rome as of    Laura Biagiotti another fragrance that    contains in its name the word uom in    followed a well known one that I bought    for the hide they brought about two years ago    years two and a half years I bought it thanks    to the yen and friends because it is the one mentioned    quite a lot I think a lot of you    they must have done it too and this is    of moschino and that is what is called    moschino and new with a sign of    question you really don't know if    is saying how is your eye really or    what because it leaves you a little baffled    that question mark in the word    cool and this is the fragrance over here    is the bottle    and this is also with the letters of a    hype there are very clear in the bottle with    the notes of a quad musk and cyclamen    or what is the same persian violet this    fragrance has a pretty touch    Italian has that freshness of that    Ricura of an Italian I don't know why    this is always said but but if it is a    elegant freshness and hue    quite clean something creamy but not very    common in any other fragrance this    I love super fragrance I don't use it    a lot but if it is a fragrance that    really worth having very cheap    a really cheap fragrance to a    fragrance that has a few more times or    less standard but it is quite rich    moschino as a brand that also doesn't    is very Haitian is not very well known but    like moschino another fragrance that    contains in its name the word    and how to let this pass and how not    mention this well-known fragrance is    so I think it is quite known many    people talk about her in the    different channels and is this from ferrari    and it's called ferrari wow and it's from ferrari    with the same bottle style as almost    all of the ferrari line with a    imitation leather here on the cover    with a pretty rich aroma and a    fragrance that has nothing to do with the note    violet but we all found a    similarity to dior fragrance    fahrenheit this fragrance with notes    Nutmeg and cedar leather as it gives    that similarity your fahrenheit i don't know for    what I think is because of the combination of    we quite well done in this    fragrance so a fragrance that    a fragrance that is also very cheap    if you haven't heard, check it out and    a fragrance that I think all the    world must have in its collection so    cheap it is and for how good it is    behaves this is ferrari fragrance    as another one that has in its name the    word    two more from the same designer of salvatore    I bring ferragamo to you and I eat it    classic how is this and the companion    or a flan care that is like casual life    both delicious fragrances are    fragrance you know with sweet notes with    notes of tonka cardamomo and ambrox and    but the note that makes it quite    quite formal distinctive of this    fragrance in the tiramisu note that    delicious Italian dessert and this    fragrance wow this fragrance is creamy    rich quite quite normal and    do you really want to eat this    fragrance this fragrance ideal for    cold weather one that goes ideal with a    jacket with a fairly thick clothes    a fragrance that I don't know what is the    current price but it wouldn't be so expensive    like when the market opens in the year    2016 and later this flanker came out    in 2017 he has the notes of    water violets and also note something    normal    the coffee note but a pretty coffee    pretty light pretty soft a coffee    it starts to become noticeable already after    the second or third hour feels like    if you enter a cafeteria it doesn't feel    a coffee as if opening a bag of    coffee does not feel a coffee that is there    circulating in the air quite rich a    Ideal fragrance for spring time    because in summer time I just    of really using that aroma not    excels and gets lost then you need    a slightly warmer climate a    a little less than 12 35 degrees    centigrade so you can enjoy the    delicious aroma of this fragrance as well    that 212 salvatore ferragamo the 1 and the    uom occasional life two fragrances that    they also have the word in their name    wow of the year 2013 with citrus violets and    vetiver among your notes this fragrance    from ermenegildo zegna that's just like that    it's called wo shows there is no other name    it's simply called hugo    Guamo external meregildo woman as well as    that of salvatore ferragamo uom or nothing else    he has the word as in his name and    this fragrance really isn't that    known or not so spoken a fragrance    that honestly has a bottle    very very very smooth very    not smooth but very sad I think not    quite large looks quite large    although it is a measure of 100 ml but this    fragrance I did not use a couple of    times and if it lacks some power    although it has the violet note I don't know I don't know    it resembles me at all goodbye couple and by    this violet note however is    citrus that help I feel it like a    fragrance that is ideal for a saturday a    Sunday don't expect much projection    and duration with this fragrance always    simply to smell good and a    fragrance that's really cheap really    I bought it in 1999 and one of the    discount stores and makes a couple of    years and I didn't use it almost much if    you can see our very empty but it's a    fragrance that maybe you should have in    your collection to use in some    day you're not going to do a great deal aguilar    an errand go do some shopping what    whatever you can use it quite well    salvatore no ermenegildo zegna    because everything says as you already    you confuse then ermenegildo zegna    how is the fragrance that also has    as in his name it is simply called    again and now to close this list of    fragrances containing the word no    in your name I bring how to leave    outside one that is pretty rich too    one that is very similar to dior's    homme intense what they say I don't have    money mind is so I couldn't    compare it but well everyone says    this is intense smoke valentino a    fragrance that is not enough to see well    nothing else says who doesn't say smoke    nowhere I don't have the box of this    fragrance but that fragrance has elegant    vanilla iris and leather is what they do    this fragrance a pretty fragrance    distinctive that touch of lipstick or pencil    lipstick is what predominates in this    powerful and intense fragrance as your    name says it durable and projects    pretty good a fragrance that is more    elegant than casual and more than ribbons    romantic office is me    cold weather fragrance works for me    perfect so time could be    ideal to use this fragrance but    you can use it at the moment that    want really is valentino there    very intense is a rich fragrance with the    iris note which is what makes    the aroma stands out and that makes it    quite distinctive if you don't have god what    my intense and you have this fragrance well    I think it's a very good option and if not    you get get it gave me interest    more like me    With this you have to fulfill your dreams    so this is the last fragrance of    listed with the word as in the name    and this is valentino as I tried    gentlemen and here they have then a    list of fragrances contained in    his name the word as maybe    some very well known as I said in    a start some others someone ever    you have heard them but keep an eye on them    I really think they are all pretty    good all are in a range of    prices between cheap to a little more    faces there are probably some have already    lowered because when they left    the hype was very large they came to be    at a fairly high price the time    has happened so I think none of    they are like fresh from the oven    so they can be very cheap well    fear and take good care    have a good weekend and see you    over here in another video coming soon good    bye    [Music]   ","22":"   even folks this is Gala tacky here and  as promised I'm coming back with another  video now before I get into it I just  want to say that these videos are  probably going to be slightly different  in the vein that they are going to be  reviews of commercial based fragrances  meaning and there is it's made by a  fragrance house or up rather I should  say a brand that produces more than just  fragrance so with that in mind my  opinion of these types of fragrances is  not bad it is simply that they don't get  me quite as excited because most of the  time they are all very similar in that  they are all fresh there's always a  fresh quality to it and usually it's  it's quite similar I'm sure it's because  of the immense amount of regulations and  whatnot but also because when you  manufacture something like this from  someone who also produces other things  they need something that's going to  please the majority instead of the  minority so you know it's not that I  mind that it's just that I don't get  quite as excited but nevertheless the  ones that I'm going to review have  gotten me if they've caught my attention  enough to deserve and warrant some type  of log and I consider this like a  journal type of log if you will so this  is by Ermenegildo Zegna and it's called  whoa mo I know plenty of people have  heard of this and right off the bat it  is a very safe fragrance I actually got  this at Macy's it was on a clearance if  I'm not mistaken they were getting rid  of him and I bought it for like 30 bucks  so I was like 30 bucks for a bottle this  big why not it's 3.4 ounces in its  quality juice there is absolutely no  arguing that this stuff has incredible  lasting power for a cheap and citrus  based fragrance I don't know the exact  notes off the top  my head but I can tell you it has citrus  I believe it's got some bergamot which  is citrus but it also has violet leaf a  cedar and vetiver in it if I'm not  mistaken I certainly get those notes in  it  this fragrance for me is unique in that  it is commercial it is cheap but it  retains lasting power unlike most  commercial fragrances in this price  range it's violet while it is nice and  light and airy because of the vetiver I  feel like that vetiver component gives  it an underlying lasting quality to it  sort of hold on gives it a bit of body  you don't necessarily smell the Bennifer  unless you really really look for it but  for me this is not minty it's not dark  and woody what it is is a citrus that's  been toned down as far as the amount of  citrus oil you smell and it's been  accented with this cedar vibe and this  violently v it's sweet throughout the  entire life of the fragrance it doesn't  ever get really dark on me it's just not  reminiscent of what you might consider  citrus based when it comes to commercial  fragrance lasting power again good 6-2  is progress six hours honestly which is  which is fine in this price range of  this cologne is easily reapplying  because for me it stays quite linear and  it doesn't change it doesn't get daring  or bold so there's that projection wise  I feel like the projection is certainly  above average for again this price range  of commercial fragrance a common factor  actually was quite nice I got a few  unsolicited comments or compliments I  should say the first day of war it's  every time I've worn it someone always  mentions that I smell Pleasant which is  always a lovely thing to hear it's not  surprising though because it's such a  nice safe fragrance short of that you  know for the price tag if you can find  it  it's definitely worth getting if you're  into this type of thing I don't really  think it's readily available anymore  I've not seen it since I bought it for  sale on in any sort of store so with  that in mind it's a nice cheap buy and  definitely worth it if you're looking  for a change up oddly enough if you're  going out in the cool months I feel like  this has the power to last indoors if  you're going to a dinner event some sort  of a formal occasion it has an air and a  clasp to it they could work in that  situation it's very weird for me to say  that but it definitely has a safe fresh  factor to it that you could hit on your  neck a few times and go to dinner and  and you would absolutely complement your  your company with this with this type of  fragrance it's it's pretty cool so you  know there's not really a whole lot else  I can say for this age group wise it's  all across the board  you could probably introduce somebody to  the world of fragrance or something like  this because it's so pleasant and so  safe and it's not weak it's it's not  weeks the lodge is it's there it's  probably nothing crazy but it's enough  to get you noticed I can't imagine a  woman not really liking this if it works  on your skin on your clothes it's it  would probably smell excellent on your  clothes so you know if you're into that  kind of thing it's clear juice ice it's  not gonna stain any clothes so far as I  can tell it's not stained any of mine so  you know not much past that really a  good short concise review of of this is  really all I intended for I it's hard  for me to get creative with it simply  because it doesn't remind me of much so  if you have any comments about this  fragrance let me know whether it's  negative or positive if there's anything  from the the zinnia line that maybe I  should try I'd be more than happy to  give it a shot see if I can get myself a  tea can't because if they produced  quality juice like this at this low of a  price point I would really like to smell  some of the higher-end stuff but  a steer in the right direction would  always be really cool especially for you  guys and and for me as well you know so  thanks for watching and we'll see you  again soon  ","23":null,"24":"   hello guys right here again with another  fragrance review today's review will be  Deniz Elmo and this is what that looks  like inside the car there this is my  sample number four I've gone through  three whole samples of this one a pretty  good feel for it by now and if you watch  my channel you know that I am a big fan  of this fragrance house I would highly  recommend checking out their fragrances  very pleasant easy to wear there's  pretty much something for everybody in  this fragrance house but with the Lomo  it's a brand new 2013 release classified  as a woody aromatic in the note  breakdown on this one is pretty basic  citruses bergamont violet leaf vetiver  and cedar so with this fragrance you can  get sort of like a transparent woodsy  leafy kind of a smell with like a smoky  actually kind of a quality to it it's  not going to impress the veteran  fragrance heads out there as being  overly unique or anything but I would  say especially for people looking for a  signature scent this does have a very  pleasant crowd-pleasing smell to it  professional I can see there's been a  good like off this scent not offensive  in any way kind of light not something  that's going to be flowing to the where  it has like this transparent feel to it  because I think the woods eNOS is almost  like a nicety super kind of a woods eNOS  where it just kind of feels so light and  transparent but the violet leaf itself  kind of just has a very airy quality  about it so if you don't like citrusy  fragrances if you don't like sweet  fragrances candy like fragrances this is  a great professional scent where pretty  much anytime probably be good for a  date-date time where all seasons if you  like Cavalli fragrances like dsquared to  Rocky Mountain wood Fahrenheit Barbary  man is one that often gets compared to  this one if they want sleeper a I think  was mentioned I haven't smelled that one  yet though but yeah if you like this  violet leaf cedar wood type  is this one it's a good modern  interpretation not too strong and a  great one to wear any time of the day I  may get into some scores here the smell  I will give it seven and a half out of  ten not groundbreaking but just to make  pleasant smell probably not something  that as a seasoned fragrance person but  I could really see myself getting too  excited about Russia and where but if  you're you know into just getting into  fragrances definitely worth checking out  rejection longevity kind of iffy here  six out of ten I would say after what  about the second or third hour very  close to the skin  uniqueness seven out of ten you know the  typical vetiver cedarwood violent leave  combo they're a little different though  I can't really say that it completely  reminds me of any one other fragrance  but you know if you if you have a lot of  vetiver cedar woods about leaf type  fragrances you know it might not really  blow your mind bright point  I'll give it four out of ten looking at  around $65 for the 50ml $80 for the  hundred ml versatility eight out of ten  I can see this pretty much year-round  maybe not a great clubbing scent it  might get lost in the shuffle there but  you know just when you just want to  smell good in a close-quarters kind of a  way  so overall seven and a half out of ten  definitely worth checking out if printed  like that outdoorsy vetiver  cedar wood and violet leaf type  fragrances in the vein of like  Fahrenheit Rocky Mountain wood so thanks  for watching guys and I'll talk to you  guys later  ","25":null,"26":"    by youtube friends welcome to me    channel I bring you a fragrance of    home well my first    Review of the house of Ermenegildo Zegna    which are fragrances that many know    quite well and others don't know many    fragrances from this house and I come to talk    of guamo that are fragrances    just like valentino smoke they create    a rather peculiar feeling    but this egg fragrance at    principle is a fragrance    that doesn't give that feeling    of being a striking fragrance or that    we were satisfied with this fragrance    but when drying    arriving at the time already has a scent    different more equitable that calls more    attention for people who have    used    the first feeling a fragrance    quite aromatic    and it has citrus touches I perceive it very    slightly but I feel that feeling more    of a more aromatic fragrance with a    little wood    and something green and let's look a little more than    information of chosen in a bomb    ideal for use in days and spring not    I think it's a versatile fragrance for    wear at night    fragrance of the olfactory family    woody aromatic for men    will be your in the year 2013 and the fragrance    contain bergamot citrus notes of    calabria vetiver leaves    sorry vetiver and thirst violet leaves    longevity is a fragrance between 3 to 6    hours and your wake will be moderate is    a fragrance    what super forms at the beginning is very    different from the fragrances that we are    accustomed to smell but if you leave a    aromatic sensation that is quite    at least for my nose quite    flashy    and many many people feel that no    it gives them that feeling that they only buy it    because the first impression is good    but    and then it\u2019s not enough to satisfy    they leave it for daily use and they already leave it    as a fragrance to apply on    emergency days in the sense that no    we were going no fragrance and point it appears    meregildo is in water or in the car and we    we apply those fragrances to smell like    something not to smell nothing    to many questions to other people if    it lasts a lot and projects them    best    Y    it's a fragrance    not versatile I don't consider it to be    versatile and many people remind you    that feeling a lot of fragrance    violet like    a simple fragrance a fragrance    clean    what brings those citrus touches    like pretty soft woods and from the    Start if you feel a citrus sensation    pretty good but it feels more    aromatic as it comes with    those violet leaves and it's not a citrus    that stays like a fragrance of    bergamot that at the beginning is a citrus    pure is not feeling this fragrance    how is citrus with not compared yes    no    accompanied together with another note quite    incandescent    but emeregildo dinner has some    fragrances    different better than uom or yes    they leave a better feeling a projection    best and superior quality friends    because the query they have emeregildo    Senna as you write one down with everything    I will gladly answer you, thank you    see you later   ","27":null,"28":"   what's going on guys so today's video  I've got Tim here so you may have seen  Timmy and you did one minute remaining  right yeah a long time ago that video  was really original yeah I really like  grabbing the yeah a bottle man he had a  box you just had like one really fun it  was it was pretty fun so we're actually  gonna get Tim's thoughts on a friggin  stud from a brand that I really like and  today we're gonna be doing a Zegna  intensive all right so I think the only  other reviewer was Henry from the  channel classy sense to touch on this  one so zhenya tencel was actually  launched in 2007 they do not know the  classification but you did sprayer both  hands because this does get comparisons  to Armani's code this is just a little  travel spray but before I ask you your  opinions the topmost of the springs are  mandarin orange lemon cardamom and pink  pepper with the mid bean iris cedar and  Bedford and the base is musk and tonka  bean is there anything that you get it  mmm I love tonka bean and I can't say I  get tonka bean okay oddly enough and I  love time but I do get something sweet  and citrusy okay and there is what's in  the base there so I'm getting like doing  my skin talk to me those gonna say  something woodsy and may be the way it's  blended the cedar is actually a Miller  idea so maybe it's that cedar then okay  all right well me I get lots of tonka  bean and a lot of iris with some  cardamom a slight citrus and a very  musky base now this does again get  comparisons to her mommy's code and a  lot of people are programmed to go where  did we do you get that vibe I get the  similarity but what's the difference  I find this one I find that zhenya  actually a lot stronger really I  personally find it more potent between  the two I've sprayed gotta be your skin  Lee possibly my skin's a little cuz I  garage I find that this on my skin is  lighter and fresher than code did you  have some similarities like this one the  codes a little bit more has more depth  to it a little bit more umph oh man  we're on the opposite I'm sorry I  actually a much more fresher it has a  lighter pressure Kate I find them to  code there's no plane the simulator yeah  yeah yeah it's not as similar as I  thought it would be but between the two  I find the Zegna fresher and this one  the way when you were saying like with  darker more death I would give this one  that so yeah this is definitely lighter  than for me so occasions what would you  say that this movie before this is  pretty versatile exam super versatile  exactly any occasion seasons because of  that freshness I want to say more like  spring summer maybe fall would wear this  in the winter probably go a bit more  darker something deeper and richer for  the winter  okay but those the other three season I  say colder seasons transition to spring  when it's a little cool longevity is not  wonderful but it's not about I get six  about six hours in projections where you  have it smile that's not a banger again  on my skin this projects more prices on  this one is this is a cheap at a good  twenty to forty dollars Canadian online  so that's like 15 to 30 in there yeah so  can't go on you know I find that with  Zen it's a great economical house that  has fragrances that do smell different  but this I guess they kind of swagger  jacker money the white facades that's  what she likes it she does say that  these two though there are some similar  but she says that this definitely has  more depth and a little bit bolder and a  little bit stronger than at the segment  intensive but she does like it she also  said that the zinnia was a pretty scent  okay so I should  so she's leathery that's her weight yeah  it's a nice that it's definitely a nice  stuff yeah so your your final thoughts  on this I'm gonna keep this video short  yeah yeah no this is this is actually  for the price if you're gonna consider  price the smell the versatility it's  actually a really good night I went out  if you're gonna give it a rating out of  four out of four sorry a rating out of  five okay I would give that a 3.5 out to  give a three a half alright so like I  said for me it's a four out of five  no very versatile is an expensive smells  great that may not be exactly like this  but I think that if you're looking to  substitute and be save a few bucks this  would be a great alternative for Armani  great quality but you're certainly  paying for the name yeah  and zagging out a lot of their presence  is online are very economical great  inexpensive so alright guy so thank you  very much for having me man thanks you  the video so guys that's our take of  Zegna intense oh so classy cents Henry  if you're watching thank you very much  for the recommendation I'm actually  gonna touch  Henry's link down below guys so make  sure to check that one out and I  personally really do like this one so  guys if you like this video please give  a big thumbs up share the video  subscribe if you haven't hit that  notification Mel thank you for time take  care then see you later

if you're new to this  channel go ahead and subscribe down a  little and stay tuned for some future  videos today I'm gonna do a review to  you by um the fragrance is called Sigma  in pencil and um basically I just got  this about I say I want to go and I've  been actually testing it out here and  there so I'm gonna go ahead and run down  my notes for you and let you know what I  think about this fragrance and I'm also  gonna introduce my wife in this video  I'm gonna get hurt opinion about this  fragrance of course you get my opinion  you get my thoughts and what I think  about this fragrance and if it's  gorgeous if it's sexy or what season is  good for but also I thought you would  also be interested in the woman's  opinion so my wife is actually um very  honest about the fragrance of where she  will tell me if a fragrance that I'm  wearing doesn't smell too good even if  it's a fragrance absolutely love so  she's on a percent truthful and again if  you're new to my channel you know I'm a  hundred percent about the truth I don't  tell you what you want to hear but what  you want to know you know my motto  so again subscribe and is getting to it  right here we have Cigna in 10 so I'm  really not a fan of the bottle to me it  it looks like a glass deodorant it's  kind of shaped like a doughnut but it's  glass  you have Ridgid lining around the bottle  nothing going in the back pretty plain  you have Sigma and tensile in at the  bottom and as for the cap again looks  like a deal rent cap hard plastic now  I'm not really a fan of bottles there's  a lot of bottles out there that are  really actually classy or really cool  but I don't really care about the bottle  it's a juice that I care for now um I do  get a lot of people telling me this  fragrance  reminds them of a popular fragrance out  in the fragrance community and that is  actually to me I kind of agree with them  I think it's an identical um sit to what  I'm about to tell you it smells a  hundred percent exactly like it and the  fragrance I'm talking about is Armani  coat not perform old original like I've  mentioned this fragrance in a couple of  my videos I'm starting to hype it up  because it deserves it I think it smells  gorgeous much exactly like Armani coat I  will get into the performance and the  longevity in this one but absolutely  first presentation there you go Sigma  and tinsel now I've been wearing this  for a while now and I think it's more  suitable for a a date night or it's also  it's also suitable for for if you work  in the office or if you're working  um in a closed environment it's  especially especially for the offices I  think it's absolutely gorgeous and it's  one of my favorite scents it actually  took the place of our money code I used  to own our money coat back in the day  but I do not anymore due to the fact  that this is act exactly a clone from  Armani code by um Armani and it's I  think it's a steal guys I paid for a  50ml I paid $22 on fragrance Netcom and  again I'm not sponsored by that website  or nothing I just like to tell you where  I get my presences from due to the fact  that I think it's a good website and I  haven't had any problems with them and  it's just absolutely good deals up in  that website  I paid again 22 dollars for this and I  know they have a 100 ml for about I  think it's $29.99 but it's still good it  beats getting our money code for around  90 to 100 dollars so let me get into  this fragrance the notes you have  mandarin lemon cardamom and pink pepper  on the initial spray now the dry down  the base the heart of this fragrance you  have iris vetiver cedar wood amber  sandalwood vanilla tonka bean and Maas  now  the beginning of the spray I get a lot  of caramel and pink pepper  especially cardamom which I think it's  pretty good I'm not a big fan of the  opening of this fragrance and I was in a  big fan of the opening of Armani Code  but the dry down I absolutely love I  think it's amazing and with the cardamom  and the pink pepper you also get lemon  you get a little citrus vibe in the  beginning but as soon as the dry down  hits within an hour two hours you get a  lot of iris you get a lot of fearwood  and musk now I'm not too much of a fan  of musky fragrances but this I believe  the tonka bean and the iris work really  really good with each other and the muss  just comes in smoothly and it just takes  charge and I think it's sexy I think  it's good I'm a huge fan of this  fragrance now um the iris does not play  a lipstick vibe on this fragrance and I  know you can either get a powdery vibe  of IRS or you get a lipstick vibe of  iris I think it plays um you get at the  end on the dry now you could get you get  a powdery vibe off of the iris note  which I absolutely no guys I can't get  enough of this fragrance now I would  show you the box but I completely  misplaced the box I do own a lot of  fragrances so I misplace a lot of the  original boxes so I couldn't find it so  I just decided to go ahead and um so go  ahead and do a review on this guys now  I'm going to go ahead and get into what  this fragrance adjustment what it does  for me and um now I've been wearing it  like I said for about a month and I  usually use it more for work and if I'm  going to go out on a date with my wife  now um does she love it I don't know  we'll get to that pretty soon she'll go  ahead and let us know herself but um  again if you're looking for a fragrance  that is actually um like our money coat  I would say go for it rings and so now  everybody knows our money code has a  huge performance issue  and you won't get that with this one  this one actually has better performance  in Armani coat to me on my skin I  believe it lasted a little longer than  our money code as well now we'll get  into that right now I'm going to go  ahead and write this fragrance and I'm  going to start off with the versatility  I'm going to give this a 8 out of 10  I could wear it all season long except  for the high summer heat I will not wear  this friggin for the high summer heat  but now on a date night with your wife  at the beach or wherever you're going I  say it is good for summer nights where  it's not too hot the wind is starting to  come pick up it's starting to get fresh  I would say yeah then go for it but  other than that I would not work in the  high summary I think it's maybe perfect  for the winter and just for the fall I  absolutely love this fragrance on a date  night in the winter I think it works  really really good and that's why I give  an 8 as for the projection I give the  fragrance a 7\/10 the reason why is it  does not project maybe the first hour it  will project pretty good but after that  guys it becomes a close encounter of  fragrance or somebody has to be in your  bubble in order to get a whiff of the  smell but as soon as they are in your  bubble and they get a whiff of the  smells are absolutely going to love that  I haven't had one bad complement of this  fragrance and I had a lot of people  telling me that this fragrance smells  again like Armani code and I believe  doom I own our money code so I actually  don't because I think this is a good  replacement for that as for um the  Armani Profumo now that's a whole  different story but we are talking about  the original so um I do give it a 7 out  of 10 due to the fact that it doesn't  project all that um in a distance but  still with the fragrance now again back  to the performance does it perform it  does within the first two seconds our  this performs really really good guys  actually get a lot of compliments with  this in the first two second hour but  again um as time passes and we get  begins to the State Fair to the skin and  you have to be actually in the bubble in  order to smell it now it does last  between six to seven hours on my skin  then I got to re-add I do carry trouble  atomizer every time I wear this  fragrance if I'm going to be out in  about for some quiet time I will take a  travel atomizer but um I do prefer this  fragrance more than our money code it  does it does smell exactly like our  money code and I just can't get enough  of the guys has better performance I  think it smells really really I mean  it's identical to our money code so and  I'm a huge fan of that it's just code  has big performance issues and I wish it  could last longer in my skin I get four  to five hours max of our money code but  this one I get about two hours excellent  asset especially for the price guys I  paid twenty two dollars for this and I  get tons and tons of compliments so um I  don't want to waste too much of your  time  so we're gonna bring in my wife and um  yeah we're going to bring her in

 first time being on my channel guys so  um yeah so we're gonna get her opinion  on this fragrance and just that I II  know guys you may not there  I wear fragrance just because I love the  art of fragrances but a lot of us were  fragrances to boost our confidence and  to UM attract the other six so we're  gonna get her opinion and I want you you  guys out there if you have this  fragrance go ahead and let me know what  you think down low and if you're about  to get it after you get it you smell it  let me know come back to this video let  me know alright oh um  enough of that we're going to go ahead  and I've actually had this drip right  here I had it I sprayed it about two  hours ago it's been sitting for a while  so she's going to get the opening and  she's gonna get to drive it down now um  let's go ahead and get the dry down real  quick and the sprayer is pretty good  guys actually absolutely love the  sprayer I think it gets full power off  the sprayer  oh all right I'm not a big fan of  spraying it on the script I like to  spray it on my skin due to the fact that  I usually have fragrances that I sprayed  on a script when I'm at the mall looking  at fragrances and when I get home and I  purchased it I don't really like it on  my skin so I like to test fragrances on  my skin but I'm wearing another  fragrance right now so I'm not about to  mix two different different type of  fragrances on my skin so I am going with  the script so um all right here we go  let me know what you think about um big  men since though I like it  all right guys um she's kind of shy  right now so this is like I said it's  our first time being on my youtube  channel she likes it I absolutely know  that guys I love the opening I love the  dry down we're gonna get to the dry down  in a minute in a minute but um please  note our money code if you had to say is  this 100% home to our money code yeah  alright guys and I'm telling you now  just telling you which one here I'm  telling you this smells exactly like our  money code I used to own it I do not  anymore and it's because of this one I  rather pay $25 to $30 for a bottle that  smells really really good for something  that smell similar or exactly like it  for a hundred bucks  alright now we got the dry down it still  smells it smells exactly like the  opening and it's been sitting for two  hours guys now we're gonna have her  smell to dry down  just let it mean you're around here what  do you think of the dry down look I am  now this is this actually has been  sitting two hours longer than this  probably like two minutes but that  sounds things down there you see she  absolutely the do you like it better  than the opening alright guys from um  you've heard now before I have her write  this fragrance I'm gonna go ahead and  rate rate in myself absolutely love it  in general I think it's a beautiful  fragrance it's good for a date night  um I can't get enough of his fragrances  actually a good fragrance now if I have  to rate it from one to ten I would go  with a solid eight point five guys I  think it's sexy I think it could replace  Armani code but the original again not  to perform oh so I give it a good eight  point five guys now we're going to get  her opinion what she thinks about this  fragrance and again she's a woman so of  course we all wore fragrances to please  the other six and or sometimes we just  love the other fragrances guys so um  again Vigna and tinsel if you had to  rate it from one to ten one saying this  record sucks  ten it being sexy what would a weighted  and eight you sure  alright guys do you like the opening as  much as you like the dry down or you  like to dry down  way better than the opening I could  write out there but the open is not  addictive  that's how I see it guys I'm not a big  fan of the opening I mean I like it but  I don't love it as much of the dry down  I get a lot of lemon and a lot of um  cardamon in the beginning but I am an  absolutely I'm a big fan of iris notes  and um seer wood and you get that in the  heart of this fragrance guys and I  absolutely love this fragrance she gives  us an 8 I give an 8.5 um and I don't  know what else to say if you haven't  smelled this fragrance I suggest you go  pick it up if you smelt it let me know  below guys what you think about it and  um that's it for today if you're new

south a is  coming at you it's my first video to my  channel the channel is gonna become  sauce here you know because we saw see I  do pretty much anyway you know I  collection I collect South so we got a  lot of South so it's the first one it's  exclusive I missed all my channels with  exclusive so the first fragrance is  going to be by Cigna it's called one  more absolute the fragrance was released  in 2014 the perfume oh what a nose  behind the fragrance I couldn't confine  any information I couldn't find any  information on base notes it's not even  a review on base notes you know you have  a few reviews on fragrance occur right  grantziger so it's quite a few people  who reviewed it maybe i said by our team  people were there reviews on it all  frantically i all of them liked it it  was 100% positive it's classified as a  woody aromatic i would i would agree  with it I would even say whatever  medical woody from share whatever they  call it but it's a real real nice  fragrance I couldn't find any  information on it though  I'm the only thing and then I thought I  was like well I did get it as a tester  for fragrance nests are like well maybe  it's not there's not a real fragrance  but is listed on fragrance cuz listed on  on base notes I searched the internet  trying to see if any of the other online  retailers had it no T no didn't have it  I think fragrance AG strawberry they  didn't have it it was one site they had  it but they were trying to charge like  $95 for and I bought this for $20 less  than $20  matter of fact as a test it's a three  point four hours yeah three point four  hours so it's pretty good just come find  the information on I went to the signal  website and I actually found that it's  on there but it doesn't give you a price  I don't know if it's only being sold in  Italy you know on bass notes I said it's  in production not discontinued then but  yeah that's all I found on it the top  notes are citrus I don't have all the  notes I'm here in front of me but this  burger monthly lemon caught her mom in  Basel the middle notes of flower flora  notes that over cedar wood sage and  something called here dying higher down  something like that the base notes or  woody notes vanilla amber and musk this  is a signature fragrance I think that's  why they called it one more absolute  because it's absolutely a signature type  fragrance you wear winter fall spring  and summer with the summer I would  suggest wearing it at night not during  the day and if you do wear it during the  day one or two sprays but you can wear  this out here it's fresh its woody its  yes it's kind of sweet kind of floral  kind of spicy but it's mostly like  aromatic fresh and woody it's it's it's  somewhat of a like a beautiful sing you  know I mean it's like you  you wouldn't find too many people who  didn't like it the first time I wore  this in the first female I actually was  around when I wore this I sprayed it on  and I went I bleed to the store you know  in our walk by a dress you like oh you  smell good compliment given first time I  bumped my sword I put it over and I  still release so it's I don't understand  why it's not well known I couldn't find  anything on YouTube already nobody  reviewed it on YouTube what a fragrance  like this it's just hard to believe  nobody know about it but I guess there  was for me to do my my introduction  video as an exclusive but it's  definitely a signature scent type of  fragrance when you spray you get a  citrusy better like you smell a bit of  it and you smell the citrus and you  smell a little floral notes you smell  the aromatic basil in the in the sage  and you smell the Carter mom is blending  I'm twice smelling so good  then later then later on the cedar wood  comes in and then you know if into the  citrus face away he left with Carter mom  you left with the aromatic sage and the  basil or the background left with the  better the woody notes a little bit of  floors but they eventually go away and  you have the amber the vanilla musky  tight dry down yes it's pretty it's  pretty good man I will say the worst  part about it is the dry down if you  want to say a bad part about it but it's  not really bad it just  the Dryad kind is kind of bland a little  but at the same time I smelled it on  side of this I sprayed this and on one  hand and the absolute on the other hand  and initially when I first about the  regular hormone version I love the  opening opening his beautiful the dry  down I really didn't like so much and  their longevity I definitely didn't like  absolutely it it fixed those problems of  the longevity he has a better dry down  but you smell the DNA of the normal and  you smell the similarity they smell very  similar but absolute juice has a more  sophisticated on classy just attractive  type handsome type smell and this one  it's a good fragrance too but when I  first got I was late on last long enough  the opening is beautiful in the dry down  it's okay they don't even last so it  would be okay if you had a D can't you  can walk around with our dance spread  you know just to get that keep their  opening on you but so I was actually  trying to sell this one but my cousin  didn't wanna buy he like why don't I buy  something you try and get rid of but I  was I was actively gonna try to sell it  together what give it away when I wore  one day you know when I put it on I walk  by my mother and she was like oh you  smell good and my mother don't even like  fragrances she said it messes with her  allergies he gives a headache I've only  heard her say she like three fragrances  in her life it's me Aiki original my  cousin had my blood Legend intense and  Zig normal so when she said that I was  like if this woman likes like how this  man I gotta keep it because she  like nothing so you know and I in  passion hey I ran through like over a  hundred and something fragrances got all  those fragrances I know she smelled a  lot of them on me and this is the only  one she have a compliment was the  regular version so they both smell very  similar but with the original one more  this is more violent it is violent  dominant you get them fired from the  beginning middle to the end but I don't  believe the absolute has violet in it  but they smell so similar it's I guess  the floral notes had some violet in it  because it smelled too similar to that  to the original and original is a  violent dominant fragrance like all you  smell is violet like we swear it first  brave it's mixed with the citrus so it  smells like a sweet fruity type violet  it's beautiful and it dries down to a  violet smell with cedar wood and I  believe this see the wood in vetiver  behind me  so it's dry that's like a sweet smoky  better I mean violet but absolute don't  don't have violent in it so I'm  believing the violet is actually  somewhere in the floral notes that it  has mixed intermediate notes but both  are good if you have if you can get your  hands on absolute you'd have no need for  this one because this one smells so  similar to this one but it has a more  sophisticated edge more handsome edge  just more classy overall and it can be  worn in our seasons all throughout the  year any occasion whereas this one  pretty much only the summer springtime  you can't write in when they were  powering last hour  so you have this one you have no need  for that one  so yeah this is my review on Sigma  absolute on fragrance net it's a it's  sold out  it sold out like the first week or two  it was on there so I don't you know you  might have to request him to get some  more but I got me a copy and I got to  beer bottle before they sold that I also  bought a bottle of another Zegna  fragrance it's car Zegna forte  i won't waste a lot of time on this one  this one is not so good to me it's too  sweet just way too sweet it's so sweet  ik and smell like a unisex type female  type fragrance I don't really like you  massage fragrances I don't like manly  fragrances I don't like fragrances that  you know smell too much like a lady can  worry I have a few lists there's me  they're classified as millions fragrance  but women can get away with wearing them  I really don't wear those the tool I do  wear it's on Juke jumpin on midnight in  pairs but I really is trying to stay  away from unisex fragrance or men's  fragrance their smell you're sick so  this one my phone notifications on my  calendar  this one I'm giving away if you liked  the video you want to see more content  like subscribe

ombo sein  de la Vega ceea ce que aqui esta es la  presentaci\u00f3n DCM elite Rose Ermenegildo  Zegna  so keep tuned for the review this is  Kate - yeah butter lettuce Enya hello  everyone I don't write here I hope  everyone is doing okay today today I  come with a review in the house of his  mini Hilda Cigna and the fragrance is  Momo  this fragrance was launched in 2013 and  this fragrance has the Accords of its  woody is citrus it has citrus is kind of  sonic is aromatic and it's kind of green  fragrance denotes this fragrance has our  citrus notes bear them out violet leaves  very bare and cedar but what you're  gonna get on this fragrance  is a lot of violet leaf of course in the  opening is very potent it opens with  citruses by the leaf and sort of very  very type of feel  you will feel it also in the opening but  the cedar gives it body gives body to it  and it makes it last for maybe five to  six hours that's what it does how last  and unless at least on me and this  fragrance okay like I said it wasn't a  blind bag in my introductory video as  you see wasn't unboxing for this  fragrance and I smell it before I sample  it before that's why I just did the  unboxing and their review at the same  time because usually when I do blind  buyers I do the unboxing then I have to  wear the fragrance I have to feel the  fragrance I have to think about the  fragrance and then I do the review but  this time I were like well I had this  friends before I know how it works I  know how to smells and okay this  fragrance in some people said it has  some reminiscence or reminds them to a  fragrance by Salvador Ferragamo which is  called subtil poram for men also some  people said smells kind of long Libre  sort of but I don't feel that long Libre  on this fragrance but what I get and  what I feel on the green vibe of this  progress the the her tea or hair ball  type of field this fragment has is that  green and hair ball by the Carolina  Herrera two one two four men delivers to  us I like and I love Carolina Herrera  two one two for men the original and I  get a little bit of that on this  fragrance and I guess it's because of  the hair T or Carolina Herrera is grassy  this one  hair the hair bow and I'm not really  fond of bio dad leaves us note but on  this one it was pretty good it was good  this is not a fragrance that he it  wouldn't make your mind blown away but  it's safe fragrance I think this  fragrance can be can be a safe fragrance  that you can use everywhere anytime but  of course it's recommended for spring  and summer  since this kind of a hair tea or or hair  ball type of feel and it has this you  know what again what I really think  about this fragrance the first time I  smell it the first thing that comes to  my mind was cumbered salad when you have  a Coke number and you peel off the cover  of the coke umber and you slice it and  then you put in a plate and you put some  lemon on it lime and you put a little  bit of salt on it I don't know if you  have tried before but I do I I have  tried it before it is very good I like  it does it feel I got on this progress  for any reason I think because when you  have the coke number and you peel it off  it has also if you have not said a kind  of a healthy type of feel that Coke  umber and a green type of field so  that's what I got on this fragrance I  think because of the by the leaf gives  this it's not floral this is hair bow  type of feel so that's what I get on  this fragrance and the violet leaf is  there the bergamot and also the citrus  and of course you will feel baby and  cedar but you see that is very very  weight in the back I think that's what  that's what it gives the body to the  fragrance because in the dry down you  start to feel more like a little bit  dark here woody type of food on this  fragrance and I think that's when cedars  start to show up these fragrance used to  run for 80 bucks when it came out in  2013 but I think the company didn't  didn't do well on sales so they put it  on sell for 20 bucks one day at Macy's  so I went ahead and buy this  it's not a friends that I know about  porches it the whole bottle for 80 bucks  whenever it's gonna happen but for 20  bucks why not  all right it's 20 bucks so nobody nobody  got her for 20 bucks especially when you  talk about a hundred mil for a fragrance  pepper so that's why I went ahead and I  said well if I don't like it I just  gonna give it away but I ended up liking  it because this like I said it's it's  very safe it's very versatile if you  wear it during the day you can use it  for the office you can use it to go out  you can use it to go even you can use it  to go to gym the people that like to  wear fragrances to go into the gym this  one could be a gym sent you know very  nice  so this fragrance is of course summer  for summer spring and summer but summer  is coming very soon so I'm gonna wear it  on summer it will be on my list for  summer that is coming very soon and  price well I paid 20 bucks for it  and I think also I check on fragrance  Netcom and these fragments is running  for about 40 bucks so it's not that it's  not that different it's just 20 bucks  more and on regular price now of course  on this counter places because if you go  to Macy's or any other department store  it might be a little bit higher you know  that okay and this fragrance ages to  wear it I think is 20 and up very nice  very versatile and for use in during the  day so in the end this fragrance is very  nice I like it it's a very safe fragment  very safe fragrance it has this fresh  type of feel also and I like the bottle  you know it's like I don't know we're  you can hear there you have this stripe  right there and he looks like engrave or  something like that and it has the name  of the company there is many he'll do  Cigna it has warmer here so here's the  information  the box the same way you can hear it and  its toll but skinny and but team and it  has the information right here it has  the code right there the secret code is  a a for which it has set here also in  the bottle you see right there it says a  a for so I ended up liking this  fragrance and like I said for the price  20 bucks I mean nobody would blame me  for buying it so but this is where I got  this where I get a compliment factor  when I wore it because I had a sample  before I sample at first and when I had  that simple I didn't get any compliments  but not any bad comments but like I said  it reminds me a lot to a umber  Humber salad with some tomato leaves on  it that's what I get is it's not a good  man progress but it's very nice I mean  is it it tends to be a fresh fragrance  he tends to give you freshness to give  you a greenness and it's very nice this  is like I said the coarser or Sonic  woody citrus aromatic and green so it's  not a complicated fragrance you see it  only has five notes and I mean if you  can find it for for 20 bucks if we now  recommend to purchase yeah why not just  give it a try so I think this is seed  it's not a very exciting fragrance but  it's not about fragrance or oh it's very  nice I mean especially if you find it on  non deals go ahead and buy if you want  of course okay  this is all for today guys this is my  review on warm advice Manor Hill the  segment and like I said please always do  yourself a favor keep on smelling good  all the time  don't forget rate the video comment and  subscribe if you haven't done it and  this is all over here wishing the best  for you so see  next time in another baby bye-bye  ","42":"   what's going on guys so today's video  I'm going to give to you my top ten  blind buys of 2017 now I generally don't  condone blind buying because well this  hobby is very expensive and now some  people get a rush for a blind buy  because you know hey you don't know what  you're gonna get  I finally blind buying half the times  some of the fragrances can be complete  duds while sometimes the other half  probably less than I would say half are  actual gems well these are my best blind  buys some of them are very safe some of  they're actually very expensive they are  in no particular order but the final  three are now the first one is actually  from the house of Xenia and I'm just  going to put this out there the house of  Xenia is going to be dominating this  list because they've been putting on  some great sense and this is becoming  one of my favorite houses out there but  this one is aqua deep bergamont oh so  with its fragrance hence the name you  get lots of bergamot you also get some  citrus notes some florals and some see  notes this is extremely clean it's fresh  it's natural  now when it comes to Zegna you have two  lines you have their upper line their  exclusives and then you have their  designer line this is kind of in between  the two now originally I thought that  this was part of their luxury line their  exclusives but I was wrong it's actually  a step down it's more this is actually a  lot more affordable than their  exclusives but this really does smell of  nice quality to my nose fragmix number  two I actually did a video with my girl  Baba Couture when I was actually in New  York City this is yo Wyatt so the notes  this fragrance you get rum a pink pepper  or white tobacco in a woody notes I get  none of that I get a boozy Accord though  but I also get lots of lavender send  them in with some vanilla I have said  this on camera and I'm just repeating  myself here but this does come across as  a combination of jumbo go see the mall  and multi individual you know a  combination of the two this is what I  get but this is a very safe scent 25 $30  I do find it is very sexy though  especially with that cinnamon in that  vanilla blood yeah those are not notes  but that's what I get  very sexy scent more of a night out  perfect portly younger men sent number  three Ferragamo  one moment casual life so will this  frequency get in Broxson or violently  coffee Kashmir would cardamom musk in  more now this is the flanker to the  original ball more that came out late  last year this one here is just a lot  fresher and not as sweet now the  original complete sweet bomb there was a  lot of sweetness with that tiramisu note  that chocolate no it is here like that  sweetness but it is really toned down  and the freshness is really amped up  perfect spring summer perfect for a guy  on a budget  and just because it does say casual life  you can wear this pretty much for any  scenario school work going out but also  upsetting formal so the next fragrance  is actually a house that I'm associating  with no a lot of the guys when they hear  the name of this house they naturally  say hey that's Chad there's oh I'm  definitely identified with this house  this is Ferrari silver essence so this  is actually a very interesting scent now  you do have woods incense cinnamon  pepper but you also get an a very  interesting note of coconut now  naturally I think of coconut as more of  a summer note but this is actually very  well blended when it comes to the  incense and the other notes perfect  winter scent this does come across as a  little bit more mature and actually mean  age was it does come across as a little  bit more of an older gentleman but this  is a very versatile phrase but for me I  picture mostly dressed up night out suit  and tie on a budget $40 of our don \u00f4t no  fragrance nuts this is actually a  fantastic scent I do hope it gets more  recognition in the community because  this is actually a very different note a  very different fragrance I should say  with that incense but particularly the  coconut blend who wouldn't know next  fragrance is from a house that I'm  really starting to dig so as I said at  the beginning of this video the house of  Zegna will be dominating this video this  here is Zegna Shanghai so this is a very  basic frequency getting violet you get  cardamom and you get woody notes now  this is really what I get for the most  part is I definitely get a lot of the  violet with a little bit of the cardamom  and I get it a little bit of the woods  but it's really just a very fresh  fragrance  with that violet leaf and the cardamom  very nice scent very simple breakdown  but I do find that this really does come  across and is a great springtime scent  more of a daytime scent if you ask me  but a very versatile pregnancy and this  here it really costs twenty or  twenty-five dollars  there's actually three fragrances when  it comes to this you got the Shanghai  you got the New York and you get the  next scent which is gonna be Milan now  with me Lana you only get three notes as  well Clary sage Santa would end fitting  the most prominent note in this is the  fig this is actually my scent of the day  this is a very green pregnancy I really  do like it this is the epitome of  springtime even though it is the full  right now but this definitely does come  across as a very green scent I think is  actually very juicy but you also get a  lot of the Clary sage so when you think  of springtime since you definitely think  of green this fragments is absolutely  that so scent number seven is actually  from a house of her mez and this is eau  de neroli da de now this is just a  little travel sprays I ended up getting  four different travel sprays instead of  the actual bottle because well I don't  need a giant bottle and I only wanted a  50ml and I believe that the sales  associate only said it comes into 100ml  so I really did not want that and I can  only have so many fresh paint fragrances  those are my types of scents but after a  while they all start smelling the same  so I ended up getting a job nationwide  and I believe I shall de pump to Musa or  something like that can't remember but  with this fragrance it's absolutely  fantastic so definitely lots of neroli  bitter orange and saffron this is the  epitome of summertime it's clean fresh  it is unisex it doesn't last the longest  apparently from what a lot of people  have have mentioned on for Gonzaga but  you know what when it comes when it  comes to try this one's on just reapply  but I do love the smell of a normally so  the last three fragrances are actually  my top three and they will be in  particular order so this house here I'm  so saying it with its ferrari scuderia  forte so you get plums the vanilla you  get cinnamon fruity notes woods and  now this definitely does come across  more is a fun flirty type ascent you  can't wear it in the daytime but you can  also wear it in the evening spring fall  I find that it is a bit of a sexy  fragrance it has some depth with the  fruity notes but also with the cinnamon  the cinnamon is actually very well  blended and doesn't give it that warming  quality but the fruits are really nice  to it  I initially only bought this it was a  total blind buy what they didn't even  have a tester bottle when I went to the  Hudson's Bay Company but you can get  this for about forty to fifty dollars  right now online but total blind buy  this was absolutely one of the best  blind bytes of 2017 so safe number nine  is actually my second best blind bag of  this year this was actually a total  blind buy and I actually had to go to  New York City in order to smell it  because they don't have it up here in  Canada if they do I haven't come across  it but this one here is still life in  real from effective studios now the day  that I actually got this is actually the  day that I picked these up so this hair  is just fantastic this is the tropics in  a bottle now so the notes again you get  tons of citruses and other different  types of citrus is in this fragrance you  get rum you get ginger you get coconut  and you get mint now this really is the  epitome of a tropical vacation you get  that boozy note you get the coconut you  get the ginger you get the citruses this  is very fresh it's natural it's  delicious and it's very relaxing like  you know what like I'm probably going to  start wearing this one in the wintertime  you know that this is really just a  summertime fragrance I can't get away  this wintertime so I'm probably going to  bust this out but scent number nine the  second best fragrance of this year for  me boom is still like an REO from old  fective studios so certain number ten is  actually going to be the best blind bag  of this year I did a video of it did a  review with Brooklyn fragrance la Mer  and I'm sorry Carlos if I mispronounce  this one but this is Ferragamo  Neku media so with this friend easy to  get pimento you get better you get  cardamom kayak would not make and the  final note is citruses I don't get any  citruses whatsoever the main notes  get lots of cardamom lots of pimento  with a little bit of the nutmeg and some  veteran fantastic scent this is  considered unisex but I do find is  really a lot more masculine than it is  feminine but ladies by all means wear  what you like but this does this does  come across as a sexy type of fragrance  but more so for the grown and sexy for  someone who is a little bit mature  because this actually does come with it  he put up a price tag  well Ferragamo knocked a grand slam when  it comes to this fragrance so the best  scent for me  live by wise Ferragamo was Nico media so  our going that is my top 10 best blind  buys of 2017 so is there any here that  you smell is there any here that you  like named the three best blind eyes of  yours in the comment section below guys  thank you for your time take care and  see you later  ","43":"   what's going on guys so today's video I  got special guest max 40 years up guys  and we're gonna actually gonna be doing  another Italian fragrance from what  house I'm in judo Sonia and which one  are we gonna do Milan so we're actually  gonna be doing meal on so I have a hard  time pronouncing that email in the  jameelah judo judo sign yeah I used to  say exactly no but it's the same yeah so  there's actually two more so you guys  nice Shanghai which I reviewed and you  got the New York so okay I definitely  gonna try the whole line cuz up guys  each spray this about 20 minutes ago and  I'm gonna tell you I'm impressed and  this is actually a like a limited  edition but they're not hard to find  just yet I'm not very expensive either  right no they're not that expensive now  this was actually lodged in 2016 the  classification I'm not exactly sure  now the notes to this one now there are  only three notes but what you get out of  this I get like this really fruity fig  kind of you know nuance going on here  very prominent it's a little bit Tropic  almost coconut vibe creamy yeah good way  yeah I like it a lot I never thought of  the coconut do you anything else though  and I think there's like a wood enos to  the fragments could be cedar could be  but surely could be you know sandalwood  something creamy and woody in the back  in the back bone just enveloping the  whole thing I like it a lot so the top  notes would be fig the mid is actually  Clary sage and the base is Sandwich  three notes that with every single  presence from like the Shanghai of the  New York ten this there's only three  notes oh wow  so I get pretty much all three but the  most prominent ones would be the fig and  the sand away but I actually liked how  you said it has like a coconut in there  kind of vibe it has like a bit of a  creaminess Coco yeah so it's very green  very aromatic I find that with a lot of  big bass sense they kind of lean unisex  would you agree yeah absolutely I find  it's more of a gentleman scent it's more  masculine but I think I made a Kemp a  little now occasions what would you wear  me long for me I think this is more  casual office wear but you can dress  this up it has this really nice elegant  classy sophistication about it I like it  a lot I'm really picking up a bottle I  find that you can wear this pretty much  like any occasion without dressing down  prices what would you said this is what  if you pay in retail if you can find it  but it's I could only get these one line  at this counter yes 35 40 bucks 25 to 30  so I deal in price tag this is 100 ml  seasons what would you wear this one  spring and summer for me early fought  the latest if it gets too cold I don't  think it's strong enough to cut through  the cold winters that we get and I have  to agree now wife's thoughts she  actually really Alexis when she didn't  really say it too much about it but she  did say it's a green mass lean tight  percent any final words for this one I  really like guys and I think the price I  mean I'm gonna probably feature it my  big BB a big bang for your buck series  and give you a shout out because I love  this stuff and a rating out of five  where did you get it for give it a four  for the price point you know the whole  proposition that the scent itself I  don't know if it's gonna last a long  time but so far it's pretty good man and  I forgot to mention but the longevity  was 8 to 9 hours in projection was 2 to  3 and if I were to get like my final  thoughts four and a half out of fun so 9  out of 10 I don't I love the versatility  the price tag the smell is fantastic and  I'm not sure if this will be hard to  find in the near future but if you're  looking for a good cheap E and you don't  mind blind by blind by there's a big  gamble to say it is a safe one and this  one I absolutely adore and I do say the  word absolutely quite a bit but I truly  do adore this one that's just fantastic  friends Andy's great is something about  25 minutes ago I'm loving it so  definitely picking a bottle as well  alright

web Josh Now in Aragon    adults always videos do wild one in    english one in spanish paragon studios in    boxing first    the xerez soft so I'm going to do    right now the review and well as I do    I will always make an English video and in    Spanish but I wanted to be this one first    video to do this the unboxing of the    fragrance so here this is the    presentation of 100 milliliters the methyl    2 have what    on the paper    blond is the one who keeps his tune    for review    hello alan friends again and as what    promised is debt as I just    say in the video that I just    you just saw the introduction of    this video was a boxing of this    es menegildo's valentine fragrance    no water because valentino egg too    I like this one because I don't have the others    a good mind this fragrance is    fragrance was launched in 2013 and is a    a fragrance that is part of the family    olfactory to woody aromatic this    fragrance has citrus chords of    woods has chords or sonic as    slightly green greens and is aromatic    and green sperm green this fragrance    includes citrus notes    includes bergamot includes leaves    vetiver and cedar violets    now that apply right now in the    video transition from a boxing to    here and well I really like honor    It is a fragrance that does not smell bad    because I don't see bad, it smells really good    fragrance because above all it can be    spring for the type of aroma that    it's because that aromatic    as for what citrus is and what    loved by the vetiver and the cedar has no    he has a little floral but no more    floral but a little more green by the    violet leaf the violet is not so    floral as well as the floral    regulate that one knows the floral aroma    regular they don't know what a little    floral with a little beyond armed with    a little I think that    floral is yesterday loved the aroma and it is to    through the violet leaves that you have    I'm not very fan of leaves    violet in regards to    note and is what this fragrance has    quite has enough violet leaf    very strong not very strong but that is what    that stands out the most about the phrase    because this fragrance is really not    nothing strong is a fragrance that is    intended to make fragrance    spring and summer now this    fragrance    and it will be very good for the summer    especially for the day    at the ages when they can use it    the people I consider so    offer that is because it has a certain touch    of freshness this is 20 years for    up now the chances are the ones    you can use this fragrance are occasions    sneakers are for walking    park to go out for an afternoon is    quite casual the truth is quite    quite versatile especially it also    can use for office also smells    very good    and well so it flies extremely well    but it doesn't smell bad it's a fragrance and I    I can say standard we could    call it that way a fragrance    standard    I don't know if something that is super    barbarian that fragrance of a million never    I had smelled something like this because in    reality this fragrance    reminds me has got that vibe    I experienced it the first time the    use in the sample that jolie like to    cucumber salad up like cucumbers    freshly peeled sliced    they put them on a plate and they pour lemon    so that's the vibe i feel i think    which is because of the way the cucumber    also when you are just that    always ice cream and what they have    taken away    protection or shell as you    they want to call and break like that on wheels    they are sliced \u200b\u200bor as you call it    has that certain a certain vibe like    grass gives and is the same as this    fragrance has then at the moment    that lime remembered her as    cucumber salad is very rich the    I'm not really saying that if you have    as between xala between cucumber with    lol tomato leaves that's what I    I can feel in this fragrance the truth    that a very rich fragrance is good    especially as for as I say for days    hot summer or for days    a bit hot springs too    so I'm going to apply it to feel    for you to see as of    spray distributes the fragrance    It has a good distribution as    you can see this is the way to spray    regular looks silver but I think    which is plastic is not metal    The bottle has these here as    I eat hairline    and you can hear this is a big bottle    what concerns to    in size but it's thin you know 100    milliliters the bottle is big    excels over many bottles but it is    thin as you can see if it's    thin and so high is here the    name is menegildo signa and here it says    egg the box because it has nothing    spectacular is the same has that    hairline feeling here the box    also and this is logical because of    same size of the fragrance and here it has    is menegildo elmer gildo zegna the brand    and the fragrance that is a hype since    has information 3.4 ounces 100    milliliters of toledo water    and here is more good information    and here is the code I think what    I put if in the light you can see there the    numbers that that's the code that is the    same code that this fragrance would have    to have somewhere around here that    I still can't find him because I haven't    searched well    we'll see    and there it says 4 is the code that you    you can look for it in    in meetic.com guys and there it also says    it's 4 to 4 16 well they manage to see us    ok and says 4    now    as I say again it is a fragrance    has reminds me a little    will install    the free a little and also for the green    what is the citrus that gives me that    note spoke ford yesterday that above all I    give that note as to    yesterday the grass vibes ford it has    carolina herrera 212 for men la    regular not only say what they smell    the same but if you give me it is like that remember me    also to carolina herrera 212 for    man and also in fraganti here then    the notes his suits of fraganti here    also says that it looks like a    fragrance of ferragamo saviors that    subtle flame by om for man of    salvador was watered so how    I say this fragrance again    it cost around eighty-odd    dollars when they were made out but    unfortunately it is not a fragrance that    so be a boom and well it didn't go    very good to the company maybe as far as    to sales refers and they had it for 20    dollars in a day on offer and there it was    when I bought it so good at    As for duration, notice that I    I remember that    does not last long in terms of longevity    or duration refers    56 hours with 7 hours depending on the    occasion and projection about two hours    good comments    no no I didn't receive any compliments in the    days I use it but it's a fragrance    that makes one feel fresh that    it makes you feel at ease that it does    feel to    how could I say well when it's a    day this fragrance is very hot    it can refresh you and it can feel you    calm as far as it goes    the aroma is a fragrance that is    quite as I repeat to can    say standard that can be used in    any time in the office about    everything for the day and the truth very good and    as then this was the price that the    I bought more than everything that's why I dared    but I had never thought about buying it    especially for the price it was not a    France and I tell you one hundred percent of unemployment    fragrance answer but when I saw her    that was in 20 dollars 20 dollars    because I don't like it    give away and but I do like it so no    I will repeat very good fragrance    fresh green and has that annotation of    freshness too    well    quite versatile so that's it    what can I tell you about smoke    faded senna and for those who have    those who understand curiosity of how it is    well, this is green    have that cucumber salad vibe    but that is very rich very very fresh and    Well, that's all for today    so please comment if you have    experienced this fragrance or that    think about it please don't forget    subscribe if they haven't already done so and this    please go rich all the time    above all and have a nice time    God bless me see you the    next and that's it for today   ","48":"   de

picked this  one up  it's from the house menos nice  fragrances from the house of Herman a  gildo Zegna called  [Music]  here's the box three cool box actually  zhenya at all nothing going on sides of  the box here's the bottle it's very  upscale yeah I'm gonna get all those  then the off button on the top on the  bottom I'll text you it on the back that  pops off when you smell this it smells  like the Mediterranean freshness but  with a darkness to it I think it would  be a very good office suit fragrance  yeah I paid $20 for this 100 or 150 ml  Bob feels like hard it's a heavy bottle  [Music]  longevity and performance longevity is  pretty good I get six to seven hours out  of this performance is very good for two  three four five hours yeah it smells  like a nighttime fighters but I think  it'd be good for office you know suit  fragrance indoors and clothes because  it's very inoffensive I think you can  pull this off any time of year because  it's just fresh when I first smelled it  on reminded me of the body wash shower  gelled of aqua impact because it kind of  has that aquatic tea but darkness to it  you know no shower gel vibe age range  pretty much anyone can wear this so if  you like a sort of aquatic but dark  justified to you know go for urban a  gildo zhenia Lola  another review from brand burgers thanks  for watching comment  ","50":"   hey whats up

had idea how many fresh fragrances or    for summer they had collection i'm still in    the day or the side in the marathon as    some of my subscribers say    some friends of mine    fresh fragrances

citrus contains    bergamot any cedar contains    violet leaves that note maybe more    predominant but in the in the mix with    the other notes that make it fresh with    The vetiver and citrus

here in the  Netherlands and I decided to record  another small video for you first of all  I would like to apologize if you hear  any background noises during this video  but there is a huge storm raging outside  right now I would also like to take the  opportunity to thank all new subscribers  to my channel and of course I don't  really want to forget my old subscribers  so also a big thank you goes to all the  people who have been following me for a  while  here on YouTube okay so let's get  started without any further ado so  today's video is going to be another  fragrance review and the fragrance is Z  zhenya by the Italian fashion house  Ermenegildo Zegna you see and I seem to  have something with Italian fashion  houses so the fragrance comes in this  simple black packaging you get all the  information on the back and as you can  see it's made in France  I couldn't remove this label and you can  see where I bought it and for how much  the buying curve is a local luxury goods  department store here in the Netherlands  and the original price was 67 euros 50  but I've got a 30% discount and I ended  up paying something like 48 euros for  the 50 milliliter bottle this is  somewhat pricey I think because this is  just your de toilette and not you do  perfume anyway actually the reason for  the discount is that the bank or  foreclosing the local branch in the  place where I live  the company has changed its strategy  they have decided to concentrate only on  a couple of stores in the Netherlands  and to target only the top Highland  segments of the market so if you go to  the bank of here almost everything would  be on sale these days because they want  to get rid of their stock probably I  should tell you why I decided to review  this fragrance I actually what I bought  it because it's not a really mainstream  fragrance and I wanted to try it out and  it was on sale so it was I thought okay  why not  but later on I searched on YouTube and I  couldn't find any reviews actually I  think I found just one but that was a  review of some samples ok guys so I'm  going to pause for a while now because I  want to remove the plastic packaging and  I also want to spray some fragrance on  my hands so see you in a while so the  plastic packaging is gone and here is  the bottle it's very well designed you  get this elegant bottle which just says  Z zinnia with a silver cap and there's  this ripple light band which wraps the  bottle with some information on the  bottom I don't think you will be able to  read this actually this is just plastic  I think it's not rubber anyway the  bottle is really very well designed and  very elegant but after all it was  designed by a fashion house alright guys  so I did some research on the internet  and this fragrance was launched back  2005 there isn't just one nose behind it  but our three of them and they are  antoine le tme green and all of your  guillotine I'm not going to say anything  about the noses I think you can look up  this information online in case you're  interested talking about the notes there  are quite a few of them the top notes  are Sicilian bergamot so it's citrusy  the Sicilian bergamot is responsible for  the freshness of the fragrance the other  top now top notes are white pepper  cassava fruit I have no idea what  cassava fruit is it turns out it's  berries from New Guinea and the scent of  cassava fruit is similar to red currants  the final top note is nutmeg the middle  notes are rosemary iris patchouli and  Kashmir woods and the bottom notes are  musk and applause what can I say about  this fragrance the first time I sprayed  it on my hand it was like a powerful  explosion it was this powerful explosion  of fruit of citrus of white pepper and  nutmeg actually it was a little bit too  powerful for me but as the alcohol  evaporates the fragrance becomes much  more gentle  unfortunately the alcohol evaporates  quite quickly it's gone within five  seconds I will say so once the fragrance  starts drying on your skin it becomes  much more gentle more floral and you can  definitely  smell the iris and the rosemary and also  you can smell the fruit and the spicy  notes the words that come to mind with  this fragrance are a crisp sharp I would  also say you fool  you know I say you fool but I would  recommend this fragrance for all ages I  think Oh ages could wear fragrance you  know I can't say anything about the  availability of the fragrance I don't  know it might be available in a store  near you it's definitely available  online but if you happen to see it in a  local store just give it a try  and go and smell it it's an interesting  fragrance and I think it's understated  also some of the reviews I read about  this fragrance claim that the scent is  that the fragrance is seriously  understated so guys that's all for me  for the moment have a great remaining  Sunday thumbs up if you liked the video  and please leave a comment if you have  any questions I will try to answer them  as soon as possible  bye bye take care and see you later on  my channel bye  ","62":null,"63":"    personal talk a lot of people asking me    by

   this type of theme but is in progress a    layers of those we want of course    communicate and on which we are working    also for the future we have faced    one of the sustainability chapters that    desertification and not just from a    technical point of view or from a point of    view of materials but also remembering    what the founder did was    one of the greatest innovators also on    this point of view because in 1938 a    in the trivere oasis that was    then a barren mountain started    this concept of forestation e    reforestation today there are more praise    a million plants taking this    concept and matching to the    desertification    we have taken inspiration to launch a    message but this is also the environment    in which this collection moves for

be doing a list  today  lists are usually fragrances I do like  top 10 this summer  top 10 most complimented top 10 lot of  things a winter this kind of February  Valentine's Day so I'd like to do list  so it's kind of fun you know to make a  change in the usual reviewing sort of  trend right so what I have for you today  is a month of February I bought exactly  11 fragrances okay and it was a  coincidence that I have bought exactly  10 because I would say 10 because I got  a backup bottle of Dewar's awash all  right 200 mil my bottles finish almost  and so I wouldn't consider that as a new  bike so somebody's an old fragrance EDT  I in my collection so I am NOT gonna say  it's a new fragrance I'm not going to  put it in this list so I have exactly 10  fragrances and I will be putting them in  order according to my liking like in  terms of smell which one I prefer  they all are fantastic written because I  did my research to buy all of them and I  really treasured them all they're really  good fragrances so if you see something  up there in top 5 top to top 3 I don't  think like the rest of them are not good  they're really good they're all good I  wouldn't buy any fragrance I don't like  at this present moment ok I would only  buy the things I love so just letting  you know  my preference so you can see which ones  I prefer in terms of smell  performance-wise they're very you now  tell you like no not necessarily top  three top two of the strongest performer  on the line no all right just based on  smell how much they make me feel happy  and stuff like that so here we go I will  start from number 10 so there yeah ok  let's start  number 10 there's a fragrance I got from  my good friend mr. part fall pie in the  community I bought them bought this one  off alongside another bottle this last  month so he want to get rid of them so I  thought like you know I'll take them  right so really these are discontinued  now and the new version is available  not as good as this all right so this is  launched on the Guerlain the EDT version  this is a big bottle 120 ml I believe  125 sorry so this is a more wearable  version of the extreme one okay so this  fragrance what it gives you I'll give  you a brief summary on age I reviewed it  if you didn't see it's a cacao it's a  little bit like a elegant a little bit  bittersweet kind of a powdery scent that  is elegant but this is not as powdery as  the extreme one okay and it's not as  long lasting as the extreme one as well  but this makes it more versatile it's  more wearable in I believe also in  summer days in the office air  conditioned zone you can wear it all  year round so very handsome said if you  are you know familiar with Chanel le  online or let's say you're online this  is and the fragrance from that class  belongs to the same class so this house  usually is in each house but the  fragrance is they make I'm not going to  say all of them I love but this is this  is one fragrance that really I fairy I  love this DNA and it's really it's  gentlemanly it's a trademark scent it's  a signature scent worthy it is written  office work you know if you like Tom for  brevity ver those kind of sense it's  it's like that sophistication alright so  number 10 I'm Stan bigger line EDT poem  okay so number that leads me to number  nine number nine is the fragrance that I  got for uh for the memories sake okay I  mean when I say guys in like I used this  back in Malaysia when I was studying you  know it my sister gifted it to me I  finished the whole bottle and I really  know this I had numbers of samples the  cans of it so I caught this again and I  really love this juice Carolina Herrera  to won two VIP men if you haven't  checked out my video check this out it's  very beautiful sweet wearable version of  Paco Rabanne 1 million and you can pull  this off in the summer as well evening  time it was very very sexy  last for a long time it is a nice note  of vodka and really like caviar and  whatnot check out my review on this okay  to 1\/2 the ipmn number nine  okay number eight you can it's not  surprised some of you because this  fragrance you will be expecting if you  know me that it should make number one  but i need to give it more testing but  initially i loved the rest of them in  terms of  smell a little bit more ok sabar GTP it  has really good performance some people  are saying doesn't last it doesn't  project yeah the projection part it  could be a little bit tricky first but  it's like the lasting power wise EDT and  ATP so for my observation loves the same  time on skin but the EDT seems to be  like projecting and just lost get bit  more than this because it's that one is  a little bit stronger than the ATP I  don't know how or what's happening but  this is not like not like weak performer  there's a very good performer 82 bits  bloatation l any day right but I have to  give it more worrying I really like it  but after a while the dried out you know  the opening it's really different it  right really love the opening still but  the dry down something happens it  becomes kind of like you know not  mind-blowing I really enjoy the rest  like next seven more in terms of smell  so your Sivaji DP definitely check out  my first impression it's a good good  solid fragrance okay I've seen a lot of  hype a lot of hate on this from certain  channels I don't don't don't do that  don't don't fall for that you know if  you love something you go for it this is  a compliment getter this whole DNA is a  compliment current okay so posh EDP then  I would say next one would be seven  number seven would be the house of  Bulgaria I have revealed this I gave it  very very good rating I love the smell  of it it has a unique note of the cactus  it has a lot of citrus atop topic as  green side little bit vetiver  it has a little bit woody aspect little  bit peppery cake and this is a very  beautiful summer and spring Sun mulberry  man extreme check out my review on this  I really dig this juice it's a and it  does last quite decent time but it's not  as screaming you know like in terms of  projection right so it's very clean  handsome and nice office set and casual  date for the daytime mulberry man  extreme is my number seven okay  number six I'm gonna pick up this  fragrance okay and a little bit sad  because I would expect this to make if  it was any other list it wouldn't be  higher up and this only fragrance I  didn't review or did initial impression  on but I'm loving the smell of it it's  not a very strong fragrance it doesn't  last all day  but it's such a comforting sign it's a  classic based on this yeah god I think  six seven good six seven eight  flankers okay now also of why I sell  this is long I'll review this I'll tell  you what I like about it how nice this  smells it has many of you to death but  I'll give you my opinion all right  so why so long is my number six big it's  beautiful it's just it's lovely every  time you put this on I even think that I  enjoyed this opening more than Lana I  don't know honestly speaking la nuit de  la miss beat very aggressive this is  very comforting it's very six in that  way it's very sophisticated scent  alright if you haven't checked it go and  counter and check this out alone alright  why so long despite all the performance  issues still a fantastic fragrance  alright time for number five top five  these fragrances I wrote them a lot all  right and I would say these five are  special if you can get your nose try  them number five a reputation by Nabeel  this fragrance is just Tuscan leather  clone but it's just so nice Tuscan  leather can wear it in the summer this  fragrance you can it has beautiful  projection and it can be worn by any  gender it's just check out my review on  this it's lovely I love to sniff this  all the time because I love Tuscan  leather and it's so well done oh it's so  tasty  alright F creation by number is number  five next is number four this fragrance  the bottle I love how it different  unique it smells some people say the  smells like where's the whole team but I  have I don't think that and this are  exactly saying this is more nicer in  terms of like safer you can wear in the  office it's perform performance is very  good it's underrated it doesn't smell  like ten other fragrances for that  reason you can try it out Xenia  boom oh the bottle is just stunning I  just love staring at this bottle alright  so this fragrance if this house has also  niche  line as well there are few private  blends and stuff but this this for a  starter if you look at somewhere for  beginner you know for their designer  collection this would be a good place to  look also you can try zinnias there's  there are some other Xenia  whoa mole I forgot the names okay never  mind this one Armani code they closed it  but this I think is very unique  all right see my review on this number  four zinnia Momo  number three is rounded that that the  other flanker you know it's like I was  talking about lunch done so this is the  extreme version okay I also got it from  Part B so this is like classic and I'm  not gonna said it's a safe line by never  ever save line I never applying by this  fragrance okay if you can know me if I'm  telling you I'm blind I don't blind by  but definitely test it out  you can either love it or hate it it's  like 'man okay it's much more darker  it's much more you know potent and much  more upper-class  than the lanced on the IDT this is a  second batch the earlier batches they  had this dark side at the bottle that's  like the first vintage if you can get  that also go for it but definitely try  to sniff this out it's amazing it's just  amazing juice you know it's like powdery  cacao it's a cold night strictly winter  night it was very up close if you can  pull it out with confidence with  radiating centres well and no one's not  smell as good as you smells like very  posh up glass and sophisticated match  your gentleman is a match your son all  right so to my nose this is number three  okay that leads me to number two number  two is a and one they are very simple  chasers I think my last two purchases  and I really had a tough time to put  which one number one which are number  two but I decided you know I'll tell you  I've put number two dear uncle owned a  little bit sad because I love this I  love this so much and that juice color  the presentation I gave it perfection 10  out of 10  okay no I'm not sure give it give it 9  or 10 but it's it's close to the 10 okay  the smell  anyone who sniffed it from me until now  on my hand on their hand paper they were  blown away how nice the smells yeah it  smells very simplistic it smells like  you know citrus a lot of citrus is like  Italian I see like edge as coach Rob  said or you know lemon a with fresh  lemon like freshly cut lemon  a lot of crushed ice on a hot summer's  day it's delicious it cool you down  it'll really it will just relax you in  the office place and it's very uh plus  it's up there for me the Tom Ford's  nearly Portofino bright narrowly what  else something in this club that is a  plus nicely done even your jobs  I tried new so the way they make you  feel Hermes the fresh fragrances its  update in terms of the quality it's it  doesn't do anything spectacular but what  you'll do is it will change up from your  whole lineup something like a Mugler  cologne you know somehow like you know  or you know whatever make you feel  different first thing the fresh tea in  the morning meal of the day very hot  afternoon you know morning walks I would  get very look into this okay just just  go and try this fragrance do not blind  by but try this fragrance it's amazing I  can drink this stuff all right  and I'm pretty sure this is not coming  my only bottle so number two dear um  cologne that leads me to number one  number one is the fragrance that have  bitten in terms of smell how it develops  how I like it how my nose likes it this  is an answer I said revoir this the only  one was missing right this is my second  man sir I just recently talked about it  and I have yet to discover everything in  this it's a very masculine scent it's  not a very young youngsters wouldn't  like in school maybe it's not that maybe  it's a halogen up you know if you have a  little bit match your nose and you like  little bit man  I mean potency a little bit development  big complexity it get lot of pineapple  and blackcurrant in this and you get  also people say they don't get the  smokiness but I definitely detect a  smokiness on this I think the  blackcurrant the darkness of that teens  that little bit smokiness and the  pineapple is very juicy  it's a every time as sniffing oh it's  like again I would say heavily  influenced by a mister pod my good  friend he's told me to blind by this I  mean I didn't blind by a sniff did then  I bought it but why I love this house of  Mansura and out getting some more from  this house I think I'll do my research  of course I'm not gonna buy everything  but this house gives you great pricing  for any house they give 120  you use whereas some stingy groups they  will charge you three times more than  this will give you only 30 ml which I'm  not a big fan I I just stated very  straightforward and I really like how  they perform this fragrance and lemon  line perform on me like be small go for  Vice praise mix it with a shirt or  clothing on your skin after a while you  just check out public's opinion if  you're in an office working environment  if you're a date see see how how the  people's reactions are if you're holding  your girlfriend or lady and you're just  going for a walk it works  12 months in my opinion any time in the  year it's it because the fruitiness  because of the like how Candide is a  mixed fruit I said pineapple and  blackcurrant but it is like mix fruit of  mix it's a melange of fruits I can fruit  bowl okay and it's like happy for you  know I really like it and the dry down  is very potent it's not weak doesn't get  weak at all high perfume oil  concentration lovely it's a champion I  gave it this one I gave it perfect and  Mansa received red bought so those are  my top ten and buys actually and I  ranked the ten according to my choices  so do check out all these fragrances  check out the reviews and initial  impressions you will be you you see why  I picked this for this month hopefully  next month I can buy some more  fragrances and show it to you talk to  you about and I don't know be crazy  about it take care guys have a nice day  out of Tucson boy

to create a    fragrance that mts is the style and essence    Italian then towards success several    advertisements mark well interesting well    beautiful and then brought one more say so    another successful perfume from zegna    but let's go to france we'll go    find the following notes the note of    way out find us citrus and bergamot    of calabria the heart notes leaves    of violet and

of a moderate projection and a    fixing from six hours to up to seven hours    at most an average price $ 118 but    will vary greatly depending on the amendment    but I just wanted to tell you some detail I    I was looking for some sites this    perfume I didn't find tanna to be the    even says it's off the charts    unavailable cosmetics season the same    thing this perfume my brother bought a    top international call store    but are you looking for you have more    lucky than me    right he reminds me a little bit about ibs    honor is that romanian perfume the bible    that you will agree with me don't have the    packaging is matte right the gray tone    embossed letters right this passes    on here    his base is smooth and let's say    dangerous only her side here in this    front and back is that it is fusca and the glass    it's very beautiful and it has these ripples    lines here is the man in high relief    also that this is not also author of    book it rains here some information but    it's free and transparent    casey the foundations alright i must say    that he is a perfume is versatile as ever    I spoke badly from the beginning is an ideal perfume    for your day to day    only i was reading some reviews    in relation to perfume    some people who compliment said that    wonderful one a delicious fragrance    others who say there is no such perfume    is common there are others better than homo    da zegna and so good my brother    he says he loves the perfect sneeze me    to work he loved it just    regretted not having found    i said they just had to only have 30    but I will give my personal opinion I    I was really good and he follows    that line of guinea yogi that is a    extremely sophisticated profile a    called sophisticated perfume that refers    to tasteful month to serious men there    repainted men so I think it's    a wonderful fragrance I don't    I realize nothing bad this perfume very    on the contrary    of course there are much more perfumes    potent and such but so the zeguinha he    has a style of its own so I    particularly i needed it worth me to    pity you know is a program    extremely tasty decent access to    your fixation of him is not so good but I    I think    which is a super valid game and    especially that summer day that    often men and women get    confused
